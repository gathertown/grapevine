      "line": 539,
      "body": "Moving `isVisibleSafe_INTERNAL()` up here ensures it will always run, even if `isAlwaysVisible` is true. This means the perf-critical `modelChanged` method, which gets invoked from a `collectionSideEffect`, will always register all observables in `isVisibleSafe_INTERNAL` as dependencies of the `collectionSideEffect`. Avoid doing this unnecessarily, since StateFilterManager is an extremely perf-sensitive file and has caused many performance issues in the past."

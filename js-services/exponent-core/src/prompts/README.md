# Single-Agent Prompts

This folder contains single-agent prompts for combined extraction and resolution.

These prompts guide a single agent to:

1. Extract actionable tasks from artifacts (meeting/Slack)
2. Compare them against existing Linear state
3. Decide on operations (CREATE/UPDATE/SKIP/DELETE)

I think so.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Okay?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: And updated. Oh wait, there we go. Posted in linear killer. Stand up so I can also screen share.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Okay. I feel like this is the state of things.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: So eval checkpoints are fully working in an eval capture tool is fully functional. I use instead of grab some of the examples that Camilla posted earlier for when the bot should skip. So I tune the prompt there a little bit. I plan on just grabbing a lot more data. Probably look at Slack more closely today and then GitHub and meetings later.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah, and then I think I set up exponent ambient feedback for slack extraction only. Right now I'm still missing GitHub and meetings, but should be a quick fix for I think David to add in.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: And then I ported this over for mapping slack in linear people, which should correctly assign people now. But I did see a case of that fail.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: And then I'll look into that.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Okay, cool. David, do you want to give a quick update?\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Yeah, so in theory. I completed the code for posting meeting extraction updates to team channels haven't covered GitHub yet. I haven't really seen any evidence that this is working yet, and I'm not too sure where to look, so I think I'm going to look at new relic logs.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: First, but I also want to confirm that I like the mapping for the way that I'm using team or linear team to message mappings or sorry, Slack channel mappings is correct. So I'm not fully confident in that part of my code. But yeah, I think.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Were you able to get that working and staging it when you tested or something?\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: I haven't tested out on staging, which is the issue, but, yeah, I want to get that working first.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Gotcha. Wait. Yeah, no worries. You can always just like. What I would do is just go to your calendar. You create an LG stand up meeting or like test meeting, I think is also one of the one of the other ones. And then you have to make it a gather meeting and staging. Go to the meeting hit record, like, say, some stuff, stop the recording, and then eventually it should, like, you know, it's going to the flow.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: I gotcha. Is there any.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: I guess. What's the quickest way to tell that? Meeting transcript recording or Sorry, the meeting transcript was processed. Is that also new relic? Just ask Grapevine.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah. I'm not sure. Johnny. Do you know what an answer to that.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Hi,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: you might have a better answer.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: The way I've done this in the past is I've just checked the database manually.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: That's how come I was doing it as well.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Okay?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I'm happy to help you\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: That sounds.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: figure out how to do that.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: All right, Sunscreen.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Andy, my hope is\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: The way that I've done it is just ask gather CPT like yo, do you have my meeting called LK stand up from 10 minutes ago and then it says yes or no.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah. I feel like the database stuff is a little tricky to set up. Japanese. Is that right?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Hello, Works.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I haven't heard from scratch in a while.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: So I don't exactly remember. I think it's pretty doable. But if that if asking LGBT works\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: that works. Maybe we seem to start saying a a code phrase in every meeting.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: A unique one, and then\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: hey. Do you know the answer to this question?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: And then I think for a log. So they just pipe into new relic. Right. If you look search like the log UI in your relic. Anything grapevine would go into there.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Cool. Sounds good.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah. I mean, you can try adding logging and ship that to staging. Just check, see what happens.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Okay. And then.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah, I think I'm just going to collect more data today. If you have time, David, can you just hook up the GitHub and beading extraction updates to exponent ambient feedback?\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Yeah.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Cool. I think it's just some constant job or variable for the channel id I assign it to you.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Cool. And, Johnny, I think you're typing up a big update. Nice.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Do you want to talk about that all, or should we just read it?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I think, really, it's probably good\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I posted the one shot eval results\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: there in in Notion.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: This isn't, like, a super formal eval, but I basically had three tasks\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: and I tried different prompts on them.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And then there's some AMP code links there as you can see.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Exactly what\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: it produced in the in the recent traces.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Three of these were fairly complex\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: tasks.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Not like a just do one engineering thing.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: But\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: actually, here's a problem that we're facing. Go try to solve it.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I think I'm gonna stop working on this today. A, it's very manual.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Doing it and just, like, rewriting these prompts many different times.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I only posted out the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: most helpful ones. There are some intermediate\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: ones, but it doesn't feel super productive. It's taking a lot of my time. Not super clear that it's helpful.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Especially while we don't actually have the rest of the dev loop working.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I think about the kind of vibe work demo that we wanna get to.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: There's some stuff in\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: there that Brent Jordan have been working on that I think I'm gonna\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: be helpful for.

Philip's going to come today.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Probably.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Cool.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: But, David, you're still only working, like, half the time on exponent, right?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I feel like those are good to get started on.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Oh, wait. Is there a normal exponent board?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I was I was sending\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: No, I think.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I think there is also I'm suspicious of our routing stuff. Like, I'm not even sure if when your search is only searching through the team that we're specifying right now.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. I I'm also suspicious of that.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: But I I think I think we'll be able to figure out all of these over the course of this week.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: find the find the data points or, like, construct the data point for it.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Which we can use Karen's new thing for.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Cool. Yeah, that's definitely the big bottleneck and the big riskiest thing in my opinion, too. Every time we've tried to do evals, it's always taken a lot longer than we thought.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Three.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So we ran into 11 judge issues with this kind of stuff because sometimes, like, oh, some of these tasks that edges are kind of okay if they have or not, and it's not very useful to put an accuracy number for them. But I was actually a little. I was looking at a Mercos business just yesterday randomly and what Mercor does for.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: The labs is they'll hire these PhD level scientists or lawyers or whatever, and they'll have them write rubrics. Actually.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And for tasks. And they'll write really detailed rubrics so that them labs can do RL on them. I know. That's actually kind of interesting.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Because with evals, we just assume that linear, like when your search has returned these issues and like, this is what we're working with context wise.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: enhancement after the fact.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Yes, for me it is. But it's wet and sticky. It's never good.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: But. Yeah. How's the weather over there?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: It's just the same. It's just always, like, 50 to 60.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: They're usually clear in California or, like, in the Bay.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Where I live, but not everywhere in San Francisco.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I'm going to enable extraction for project exposure.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Okay?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I did that.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Sorry. I saw your message.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: That was in a different\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Mhmm.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Keep wait for him. Should I? Quick question for you Camille, while we wait. I was working. Oh, no worries. So I was started working on fast eval capture for debugging real issues and I wasn't exactly sure what linear context to capture the way that I have it right now in sharing.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: So I made a new page where you can just paste in either like a Slack thread or a PR URL or Nature script title, and then you can select a linear team. And right now I'm just pulling the 50 most recent issues from the team because. Yeah, but then I realized this might be tough unless we went back and like, retroactively under the operation that they did incorrectly or something. So, like, would it be more helpful to save the 50 most recent issues at the point in which we extracted and then like, say that to the database and pull it or something?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: May maybe we just\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: actually\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: do specific linear issues.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Then we can go\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: fix it after the fact.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: What do you mean by that?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Okay. So two two things here. One is that\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: for these test cases, you usually don't need the whole linear board. You just you just need, like, the few issues that are at\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: fault here. So if it's like a ticket creation, you actually don't need any issues at all.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Right? Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: If it's, like, if it's updating, you can just pick the those few issues.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Then if you have only a few issues, then, like, maybe once you've generated the test case,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: can just go and edit it manually to, like,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: rewind, and it's not that bad.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Capturing all that, and you just go in and and, like, fix the\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Oh, wait. Sounds good. Then maybe won't populate any of winter stuff.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: interview to not interview or whatever.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Okay. Yeah, I got you. Okay, so right now it just downloads the file and then what? The truth is, but it sounds like we can just manually populate that. I don't need to list the issues.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. I think that's okay.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Okay, cool.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: You can just copy paste some issue issue numbers.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Sounds good.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yo.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Look at the model is called five zero.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: It's off 5, though. I think it's a 5 something. 5 something. 5. I don't know.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Cool. All right. Should we just first update on all the work from last time?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. I'm adding a section for you guys up here, actually.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Do you guys want to just write into your name?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, Wait, did you guys reprioritize? Is David working on something else besides.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: The things that Justin raised in the division. Doc, Updates we talked about yesterday.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: David speaking.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah, I DM'd him that there are a couple of small ramp up tasks that he can take first.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Including, like, posting and slack after extracting a recording or stuff like that.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah. And then when we actually move something to interview because the PR was related to it, like, we should link it in linear so we know what's up. Right now it just says in review, and we don't know why.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Right now.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Okay?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Sounds good.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. And then come out. We should be getting.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Updates from Exponent for old meeting transcript and slack combos now.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yes.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. And then I go to which board to check amount.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Just the one called X exponent mirror.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. I I\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: exponent mirror because that was the only exponent board that I saw.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: It should be mirror.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, I don't know what exponent local is.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Exponent local is just, a local debugging board for us.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Wait, why is create intercom connector on our board?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, is this everyone? Is this across everybody?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: There there's something really funny going on here. I'm not I'm not sure why\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: this is on our board.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: This is yeah. This is something I wanna look into\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: today.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think it should not be going here.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, do we need a better way to test this stuff? Because it seems like there's a lot of bugs with.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Our exponent flows that we only find.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Days later because we had to wait for actual meetings to happen.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think this like,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: integration level stuff is kinda hard to\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: have test for.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: We'll have the evals for, like, the quality problems.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Maybe logs will at least let us know how this happened.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. There there are definitely logs which\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: can go back and look at.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I can put that on my list.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Cool.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think these, like, integration issues are, there there aren't that many of them, and\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: we'll see them happen.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Right.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, and then how are you guys playing to generate the eval?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: So I think for\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: meetings, I'm just gonna go look at some meeting transcripts and\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: manually\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: write up what tasks I think should\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: be there from it.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Slack, I think we already have a little bit of\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: evals. And then I think beyond that, it's\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: as things happen and we see quality issues,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. The other thing that Erin and I are adding to the\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: framework is\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So I just make sure.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: making it so we have ground truth for everything. We have an LM comparison so we can\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: continuously run these and make sure that quality hasn't regressed.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah, okay.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Actually one way you could even do LM judging in this case.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Is. You could even write, like, a plain text rubric for each data point. Actually.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Actually maybe a better way for us to do LM the Judge.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: In our case, too, because you can just say, like, for this data point, make sure you get these three tickets and then the other tickets. It's okay if you have them or not.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Mhmm.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. That that makes sense to me.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And it actually makes it easier for a human to onboard onto this eval too. They just read that stuff and they without having to read the whole transcript.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: What's up?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Are you saying? Instead of like a fixed ground truth, like JSON, something to compare against? It's more of just like text.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh. And so I think. I think having a ground truth is good, but then additionally, maybe having, like, a plain text note on how to evaluate this.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Got it.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Structure.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: That makes sense.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. Yeah. So I think the main thing is really just.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: You need the ground truth at all, or is it okay to just write the text description?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Like, expect these three tasks to exist\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: This task should have gotten updated.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: To\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah, it's probably okay to do either, I guess. I'm guessing having a ground truth will still be easier, though.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Even for, like, a human to parse. Like, just go on. An example of good tickets would have been.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Mhmm.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Fair fair enough.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, cool. Yeah. So however you guys can. I would just put as much urgency and risk mitigation on the eval.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And like everything else, you can hopefully just be done in time, in between to filter gaps or whatever may happen.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Mhmm.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Karen, I know grinding evals is not your most favorite thing, but hopefully collecting eval is not as bad as granting the eval.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah, makes sense.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Also to call it out, I\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: have, like, half of today is gone for me due to interviews.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah, we might. Honestly, our interviews are kind of long.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: How little link in my counter. I was like, this is a long amount of time for one candidate.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Oh, one of my interviews got canceled. Good stuff.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Nice.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Okay. I have more time today.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. I'm also thinking that.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Johnny, tomorrow you should probably be helping on evals, because I'm sure that I kind of feel like this eval will take at least, like, two to three days to collect.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And feel like it's good enough for us to iterate on.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: It will make sense.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah, I think. I mean, something that eval doesn't necessarily solve is like whether or not our linear search is good enough right now or actually identifying correct issues.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Mhmm.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Are you saying that from the perspective.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Of. Do you think we should prioritize? We should order this stuff differently or what?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I think it's a risk that has yet to be seen, necessarily, because I think we have a lot of issues with our prompt. But it might still be an issue after we fix the prompt.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah, okay, that makes sense.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. That's also something that again, like, we get time for it, we can write\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: an eval for even.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: It's very interesting. Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Mhmm. Actually, is that true?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Wait. A frozen lanyard?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: It's a little bit tough.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. The the frozen state is a little tough.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah. I wonder if you're actually. If it's actually worth doing that versus just.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Maybe you just tested by vibes in the wild.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And look at traces.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yep.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: The main purpose of working on E valve is now just to ensure quality.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Well, I think ensure quality implies that.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: The quality is already pretty close to good enough. I think that's actually kind of unclear what the quality is.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Mhmm.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And then I think the second thing is.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Evals is probably the most reliable way for us to test and iterate on quality issues.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Right. You think about the system.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: If you see examples that are bad in the wild.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: How do you fix that issue?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Well, you need to anyway. You need to extract that data point and locally. Just keep running on it and testing on it until it becomes good.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And that's essentially kind of what you just do with an eval, except instead of a person collecting that data point and just storing it, when they do that task, they just store it in, like, a shared place.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: You need to do that. And then in the process of tuning it for fixing that issue, you need to ensure that all of the 99 other issues in your e all set like don't get affected.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: It's it's basically just unit test for LLMs.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Yeah, that's right. It just sounds like AI test driven development. That makes sense.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: That's I think that's the right way.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah, it basically is.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: It's a new term. AI pb.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Wait. Dude, I was telling my non AI friend that I was grinding evals, and then he was like. He thought I meant, like I was writing performance reports for people.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: That guy's gonna have to learn. Pretty soon, everyone's gonna have to grind evals in some form or their job.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: He's a PhD student in biology.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah. Still, I feel like it's a matter of time.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: It's true.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: It hasn't reached him yet.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: What we could have gotten Andrew excited about writing emails?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: What do you say?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Maybe we could have gotten Andrew excited about writing evals.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, yeah.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I'm good.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: This is the most test driven development we've ever done.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. That's kinda true.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Or it's, like, the most important test driven development has ever been.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: But Andrew would not enjoy the engineering part.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Just changing a prompt.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. That's very true.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Okay. Outside outside of evals, what exactly is\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: David working on? Like, what are the Slack bot related tasks?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, he wrote it under.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: We should have the slack bot report what's extracted from every recording. I think we lost that in the pour over from Exponent.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yep.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: So that'll be helpful for debugging. And then I was thinking that we should have in the linear operation, when you update something to interview or merge, it should just link the GitHub issue. I know, Johnny, it's not necessarily that important from the vibowork demo perspective, but it'd be a lot helpful for debugging while we are working on stuff, it should be like extremely simple to add.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Not too for that where willing the pr this would be in the GitHub or sorry, this would be on the linear ticket in slack.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah. Fill in your ticket.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: David, one more actually tiny ticket that\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: might be good for you to take on\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: is\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: can you make it so that we add a different label for triage tasks\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: versus ambient tasks?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Have this, like, separate flow, which is bug triage.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And they're both right now labeling things as exponent, but\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: for Johnny's purposes, it would be useful to have\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: these things differentiated.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: No. She's not super important for me anymore.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: I'm good.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I just focus on the IVP.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Tasks.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And those are all and, yeah, just don't think we have a.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Okay. Cool. Then we we can maybe just ignore that.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: The one other thing that I think we mentioned\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: we really help on the quality side is the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: we have different prompts for the yeah. Tickets\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: With the triage tickets,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: have\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: more subscription of\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: what to do.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Pouring that over\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: would\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: definitely helpful because if we extract the tickets or one liners right now,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Is that something on either of your plates or something\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: David could do or something I\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: could do?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I know what the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: level of difficulty is.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah, I think that makes sense in concept. I think my main hesitation is that it would pull an Aspasia into our extraction loop, which would make making tickets have like a five, six, five, three to five minute delay.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: And right now it's pretty instant.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Can make this a separate stub.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And then this will also\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: for the sake of running faster emails.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: We can extract the tasks and then do\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Got it.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: do the\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Like, maybe it could be, like, an async job somewhere.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: In the background. Like after we've extracted the task, we populate it with better details.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. I think this is on no one's plate right now.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: This could be what David works on next instead of\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Notion depending on\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: what we think is more important.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: For the demo.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Something I can bring up in features handoffs because I don't expect to get there into at least tomorrow.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Until at least one.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Until these end. Data, mara.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Got it.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Mikamil. That's a good that. You mentioned about labeling Biosas. Was that still something you wanted to do?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: No. I think we we can ignore that. I think it it sounds like Johnny doesn't\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Okay?\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Sounds good.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah.

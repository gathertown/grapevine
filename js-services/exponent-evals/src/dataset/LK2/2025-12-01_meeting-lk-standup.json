Evangeline will finish two customer calls this week, while Karen takes full ownership of extraction quality, Kumail builds a robust eval framework and fixes connector issues, Johnny defines what a “good” ticket looks like for coding agents, and David adds Notion-doc support and resolves the ingestion-race causing duplicates. Success hinges on high-accuracy evals and quick feedback loops; unresolved is an easy UI for adding real-world artifacts to the eval set.\n\nNotes:\n\nProject Focus & Vision:\n  - Shift all effort to high-quality ambient extraction as foundation for ‘vibe-working’ demo\n  - Goal: internal system that handles ~70 % of PRs automatically, then public demo video\n  - Triage-bot line of work put on hold except bug fixes\n\nOff-boarding & Customer Calls:\n  - Evangeline exits day-to-day work; two Linear feedback calls (Zena & Komi) still on calendar this week\n  - No other explicit off-boarding tasks for now\n\nQuality & Eval Framework:\n  - Need comprehensive end-to-end evals for Slack, meetings, GitHub; meetings seen as hardest\n  - Karen already built GitHub eval prototype; Kumail to create fake datasets for Slack/meetings and port old evals\n  - Desire for quick way to turn live artifacts into eval datapoints to avoid future blind spots\n\nTicket Format & Coding Agent Integration:\n  - Extracted tickets currently too sparse; richer context raises agent success rate\n  - Johnny to experiment with triage-style prompt and define ‘good ticket’ spec\n  - False negatives more critical than occasional duplicates; focus on context & accuracy\n\nWork Allocation & Timeline:\n  - Karen becomes overall quality owner while Kumail travels Wed–Fri\n  - Goal: resolve all red-flag quality issues by week’s end, but risk lies in labeling sufficient eval data\n  - Phillip & Kumail in Bay Area mid-week; others expected to drive work independently\n\nInfrastructure & Connector Issues:\n  - Staging now running; config editable via UI\n  - Grapevine QA stand-up artifact failed—needs investigation\n  - Slack/Linear duplication caused by ingestion lag; proposed fix: also query Linear API\n  - Request to restore Slack channel that logs artifact → ticket activity for visibility\n\nAction Items:\n  - description='Coordinate and attend customer calls with Zena and Komi about Linear this week' due_date=None assignee='Evangeline'\n  - description='Create fake datasets and end-to-end evals for Slack and meeting transcripts' due_date=None assignee='Kumail'\n  - description='Investigate and fix Grapevine QA stand-up extraction failure' due_date=None assignee='Kumail'\n  - description='Re-enable Slack notifications that post every artifact and resulting ticket update' due_date=None assignee='Kumail'\n  - description='Own ambient-extraction quality and red issues while Kumail is away' due_date=None assignee='Karen'\n  - description='Separate Ask-Agent code from main eval loop to keep tests fast' due_date=None assignee='Karen'\n  - description='Define criteria for ‘good’ engineering tickets and test with coding agents' due_date=None assignee='JohnnyD'\n  - description='Add experimental code/tests for ticket-quality experiments without slowing core evals' due_date=None assignee='JohnnyD'\n  - description='Implement Notion document processor & prompt, then integrate into extraction pipeline' due_date=None assignee='David R'\n  - description='Resolve ingestion race by combining Grapevine search with Linear API to avoid duplicate tickets' due_date=None assignee='David R'\n  - description='(maybe?)

I think there's some customer stuff in it. Otherwise, I don't know if there's other stuff besides that.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: How do you actually have how do you actually have an agent write up the test plan for it that's actually accurate to what we do within our company? And then how do you actually have a browser use agent run that test plan and take a screenshot over the change it made and send it back to you? So it's really easy for you to just say like, yeah, this is done correctly, or it runs curl commands to towards API endpoints, right? And then tells you like, oh, cool, you do this properly. And I think our take is that if we can build this whole end to end thing and we actually use it and it's. And we can write up some blog posts about how to do the parts that are not productizable. You know, like, all the dev environment stuff is, like, very specific to.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Just straight up.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Hey, I actually, like, lost more of these things that you guys talk about could just be done by agents.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah. I say our role within this problem is still ambient. Task extraction.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And then lastly, the problem was how do we make ambient task extraction?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. I think I think that's\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: kind of\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah, a lot of fake launch videos that show off this exact vision.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: They're, like, not real.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: we can have a it has something real, but it can be a minimal version of the real vision.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay? And this one solved by just having.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I see.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Camille, when you said it works in staging, like have you turn it on for Project Exponent channel?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I think you want to go to stg.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: No app.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: So I have credits for that that we can use.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: So I guess the way that I see it is, like, we need to create data sets for the three artifact types that we currently support, which is like meeting Slack and GitHub. I was working on GitHub yesterday, so there's like a small GitHub data set, but we should make them for fake. Media transcripts as well as fake stock messages. And then tune quality on those because those are like entirely different props.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: that improves it.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And then, ideally, if you have the right corporate context, given that you have a pointer to a meeting, you actually kind of know what other types of things are more relevant to it.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Without using keyword search or it re ranks the results you get from keyword search because it knows it was a part of this team. This team also has these Slack channels and these other meetings.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: write the code.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: On what is the problem it's trying to solve.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: oh, here's the repro, if there's a repro.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: It's\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And we actually already have a linear API\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: noise.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Could\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Hello. Hello.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Awesome.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Welcome back from the war, David.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Okay.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Again. How's your guys'thanksgiving.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I spent twelve hours in the ceramic studio.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: On Thanksgiving.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Just accompanying Rachel.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Making plates.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Rachel,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: yeah, Rachel is is a\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Bro. You made some plates.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: running behind on her\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: holiday markets.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: So she needed to hire a helper, and the helper was me. And I got paid nothing.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Guys want to see the dog that we're dock sitting? No. Pete, say hi.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: If liz and wills.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, my God.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Whose dog is that?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: We got him a toy from Target and he ripped a hole in it.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: So we took out all the stuffing, and he still really enjoys it, even though it's no longer a plushie.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, my God.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Door.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Cool.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, So I think actually before we start, maybe a van. Okay, so van's going to work on current starting later today. And so I guess the main thing is what do you have to off board?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - df601bb6-6d7e-449a-8658-41780e6c17aa|evangeline: Yeah, I think just like, customer calls, which we have Zena and. Oh, man, the other company. I'm forgetting their name. But we have two calls scheduled this week. Sorry, Co Mean. So Zena and Komi are gonna talk about linear with us this week. Philip and I'll still draw in the call.\n  - df601bb6-6d7e-449a-8658-41780e6c17aa|evangeline: I think in terms of, like, engineering stuff. Like, I'm sure I've, like, contacts that I can, like, sync with people on, but nothing to, like, explicitly offboard right now during stand up.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. Okay, that sounds good, then.\n  - df601bb6-6d7e-449a-8658-41780e6c17aa|evangeline: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Cool. All right, then I think that's all you need for in this. In this meeting, then, as you go and find Jenin.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: See you then.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay? And then otherwise.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Let me know if you guys feel differently.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: But I think we just focus everyone else towards making ambient extraction really good.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Towards the goal of this vibe working system.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And all our other customers we can actually just chill on.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So I'll explain this to David in just a sec. If everyone thinks this is the right move.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. This is what we talked about\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: last week, and I think\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: will remain true. Nothing has changed.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. Yeah. So, david, for context,\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: We have historically had two different.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Like products within exponent that we're working on. One was ambient extraction, which is just take every single slack conversation, listen to every single meeting and extract out exactly which tasks you should do and then listen to all GitHub PRs and mark them as done as they get done. Basically. Can you just never have to touch linear yourself anymore.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: The second thing we worked on was a triage bot. So it just takes something like bug reports, channels, and it uses company context to understand if this has happened before, try to do a basic understanding of what they think the issue is, and then turn that into a linear ticket automatically. We built the second one because as we pitched people on ambient extraction. A lot of people were like, oh, that sounds nice, but this is the problem I want solved today.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And we launched that to around.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Six or seven customers.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And people are pretty happy with it. But our hope with this was that it would give us an in to solve more and more problems with them.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And it hasn't really felt like this is the case. Like, we kind of solved this problem for them. And then we asked them, do you have more acute problems with project management? And it doesn't really sound like they do, at least when we post it that way.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So now the direction we're interested in doing.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Is turning this work into ambient extraction. Do part of a broader vision of just, like, vibe working. What that means is as you just talk about stuff and decide to do work, it just gets kicked off to, like, a coding agent.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And then the work that Johnny and co have done is they've worked on things like how do you actually spin up a dev environment?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: In the cloud for each one.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Our particular repos, but we, like, just talk about the whole system and we can even take a video demo video. We just maybe an example of like a meeting like this, but sped up 10x and no audio, maybe. And it just. We just show as a graphic, like all the tickets that get created and started on and. Like, by the end of the meeting, you could be like, oh, 70% of these can just be, like, merged.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Like, I think that's the demo we're interested in pitching to people. And now the pitch isn't about, like, generic project management, it's about.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: That then you're doing right now. And the ball next, to some extent, is like humans having to coordinate all of that. And then like, usually when humans do work with an agent, they can only have like two or three Claude code sessions versus this can actually just spin them all up in the background.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And our hope is that this is a more compelling, comprehensive pitch because it's more related to.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: It's more related to actually getting things done versus project management, by definition is like work around the work.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Got you. That makes sense. The only thing I did forget was the name of this. I know there's Evian baptized Taskus fashion which is fought under that versus a separate thing entirely.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Like high quality, like high accuracy, basically.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And a van had shared this flowchart.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Previously.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: That basically outlines the different flows and issues that exist today.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, and then one last piece of context as we plan work.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Is me and Kamel are probably going to be pretty occupied. Like Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, we're flying to the Bay Area and talking to, having some opportunistic conversations with exciting startups. And so I think it would make sense if you guys, if we have some kind of setup for this week or someone else. Can where you guys can. People who are not me and Kumalk and own this work and drive it forward.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, well, we can talk about all that stuff as we get into the details.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Maybe first we understand what the state of the stuff we talked about.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Is at.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: As you come out. Do we still need to track this? This is done. Or is it good?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. So we're we're just gonna hold on this for now.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: This is probably just a bug fix, but also I think it's, like, okay enough in the state that it's at.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And we'll get back to it if we ever get back to bug bug triage.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And then.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: This.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: This is done.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And, also, everything works in staging now.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Cool. And then recording is on, is done as well, because I saw a recording actually start this time.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah, Recording for specific whitelisted meeting titles like Grapevine and lk. Stand Up Stuff. Or automatically recorded now.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: But this doesn't fix like desk and ad hoc meetings.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah. Okay. We can do that. If we decide we can almost treat that as part of the qual, as part of the quality.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think one other thing to call out before we get into the the details is Karen's question.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: In chat.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Are we are we trying to get\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: something working for us internally, or are we trying to get to a demo\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And the and the answer here is I think we're definitely trying to get to it working for us.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Internally because\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: that is the way that we can make something actually compelling for people to see and\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: because I think it's not very interesting to have a demo video\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: isn't backed by anything real.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: This is something that I think a lot of people have\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: already\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: you know, like, there's there's there's a vision that people have.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Async agents just going off in the background and doing work for you. I think the interesting thing is if it actually works for us to some degree,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: degree.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And so what we wanna do is get something working internally,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: that is creating real value for us,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: and then talk about how we did it.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And and then that, I think, will be a compelling thing to show people.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. This is like Devin's launch video back in the day.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Well, no, I think Devon had real concrete examples, right?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: They. But they weren't like, vibe working. They were just like, you send.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. That's true. I think this is my vision that they were selling.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: You know? Like, this is a vision that people had.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: It is it is, I think, worth calling out, though, that, like,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Like, Devin's video was\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: one PR that they'd clearly tried before and practiced.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And then the vision they pitched was, well, async agents could go and have AI software engineers.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Still not there.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I I think that,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: as we think about this, we should think about list of\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: middle version that we can build for ourselves that we could then demo and still talk about the big vision.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: We don't have to do everything.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: To start talking.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah. So I think the minimal version is, like, we built a lot of specific components for ourselves.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: But the thing we need to be able to say is our team actually spends no time on 70% of these PRs.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And that's because we built a bunch of these things, and this is what we did, and this is how you can do it yourself.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah. We should have a nontrivial amount of PRs that we're merging automatically.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: It's, like, a very\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: cool stat to talk about.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Cool. Okay.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So I think we'd also divvied up some quality work.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Oh, wait. Sorry. Also, for the internal adaptation goal, like, we should just not worry about any sort of productionizing.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: And just do hacks at work for us.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. 100%.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Okay?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Cool. So for the stuff that we did decide on,\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: I think there was some. I think Kumail, we said, you should create an Evon. Then we had some more specific problems that Karen was going to solve. I think on this side, on the GitHub side.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. I I have not gotten to the eval. I I've not really put any time into the eval yet because I was\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: debugging why things weren't working in staging.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: For a while. But now everything works in staging, so this this will be what I spent today on.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. And then, Karen, how is the state of this GitHub a meeting trans.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I think for the quality, there are three bullets I worked on. I think the second bullet is solved. And then I was thinking for the third bullet, like we don't necessarily need to solve it ourselves, but just have like the cursor auto filled out PR description, like turned on for every pr.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: And we can see how it works with that.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Agent.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: As.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I just tune the prompt. It was just matching too much on keywords and not on functional areas and requirements.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah, okay.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Well, I mean, I can validate it more with I set up evaluates for this. I can run more evals on this just to, like, double check, but from a cursory.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Check. It was mostly fixed from just prompting.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. I guess the third one.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: I mean, what you said works if we're talking about purely automated tickets, right? But I guess part of the problem was people manually do a thing and it doesn't get marked as done in the linear.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: But. Okay, I guess your point is, like, this isn't actually relevant to the demo we've been talking about.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Maybe we're talking about different.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: At least there's one detail here, which is, like,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: we have this thing that is turned on right now where cursor automatically writes descriptions for PRs that don't have a description.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, we already have that.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yes.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, got it. Okay, so that should supposedly solve this, then. Is that what you're saying?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: There there is one detail here, which is that I think we don't\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: updates don't work properly right now.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Where if a GitHub PR comes in\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: we'll extract tasks based on the description. But then if an update comes in on it, we don't process it again.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And I think we did this deliberately to avoid, like,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: duplicate stuff happening.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: But\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: we should we should probably do something here.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: So I I think, like, what'll happen in practice is the PR will come in\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: It'll get processed with amine extraction with an empty description.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And then the\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: actual description comes in and nothing happens.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I can write that down.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, now, I think the question is.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: How should we split up all remaining work?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Amongst the group of the four of you guys.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Was also the plan of Kamel not being critical past Tuesday.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Yeah. So it's on in project exponent.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: It's on for\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: it's on for the Slack channels and meetings for\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Grapevine QA, Grapevine connectors, and project exponent.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Okay, this was like, a recent change, right?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. This is as of this morning.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Oh, gotcha. Okay.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. The config is also in the UI now. So if you wanna change\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: feel free to\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: do that.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Four.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Wait. Interesting. I want to see this too.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: UI is pretty nice.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Go to stage.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. Sdg.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yes. Stg.groupfind.ai.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Wait. Where did you define the number? Where did you define the teams? That's hard coded.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: So if you add routing rule, it'll let you select a team.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: These are just all our linear teams.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, I see.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Gotcha. And how does it do the meetings?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, wait.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, this is the name of the meeting. Oh, I see. I see. Okay, cool.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. It's just a it's just a string match.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. And this is this is just taking our hard coded config and putting it in the\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: It's it's not it's not background breaking.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Right.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. So, yeah, I think back to the question is, how should we divvy up.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: This work.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: The evils are important for.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Shirano. The evals seem pretty important for.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Generically everything, right?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Wait, so what area of evals we're going to work on came out?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: You know what? I'm honestly not entirely sure.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I I wanted to create just, a end to end eval framework where\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: we can easily say something like, okay, given that\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: this meeting happened and then these Slack messages happened, what is the output\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: tasks that we ultimately wanna end up with?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Oh, this is done. I did that yesterday.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Oh, you did?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Okay.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: You run it on, like, a document? Like a Slack message or meeting transcript? Oh, actually, I didn't hook up any transcripts, but I hooked up Slack and GitHub, and it tells you what operation it does for linear.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: By running single agent strategy.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Nice. Okay, cool.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: What's the existing linear state that it assumes?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: You put in a grape buying tenant in an API key. So like anything.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, okay, so it uses, like, the current state.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I also have access to my frozen tenant from David Victor.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: And that's from, like, September or something.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: But that's a little tough, I think, for frozen tenants, because you do actually want to, like, be able to see it with tasks and, like, tweak tasks and stuff and have, like, the actual grapevine state reflect that as you run evals.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: If you think about. If you come up with a new task seriously.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: For each of those three document types.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. That makes sense.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: There's also a meeting note, right?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Like notion docs.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yes. This hasn't been made yet.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: We haven't supported piping that yet. Yeah.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: So that would involve creating a new prompt and workflow for Notion docs and then running emails on it.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: So it's those four areas, and then I think there's, like, everything else is more like, workflow, like pipeline issues.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Mhmm.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Like updating the wrong we should never update. Done. Cancel duplicate issues like all the other stuff on the left side.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Right.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: And, like, ui ux stuff.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Okay. So I I think my goal today is just have\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: fake datasets for meetings and Slack.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Okay?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: We have emails for them.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Given the kind of\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: focus here on\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: build these for an agent to consume and and execute the tasks,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Sherry, if I'll go further,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: of actually, like,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: passed to a coding agent and see how well the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: result is. One thing I'm wary of is we don't actually know what a good task\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: like right now. I'm not sure how you guys have talked about it in the last few weeks.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Nothing has plugged into exponent.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: But\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: do we\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: feel like we know what the right tickets are to create\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: coding agent to execute on them successfully.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: We're gonna eval against the wrong thing if we\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: just kind of grind it out.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. I think I think we don't have an intuition for this yet.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I think we were mostly focusing on quality wise. If it even extracts a ticket in, like, what? Yeah, just like the bare bones, like problems. If I say I'm going to fix API, whatever, whatever. It, like actually pulls the ticket from the contents of that. But we haven't looked at the quality of the ticket outputs. At all, because I'm pretty sure what it would say in that case is like, fix API like whatever issues and then like have basically have nothing in the description.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Johnny, actually, if I I don't know what you're up to right now, what your priorities are, but this would be a a really useful\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: thing you to do.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Is\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: get some stance on what a good ticket looks like.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Think that's what I wanna work on as well.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And I I I expect it might diverge a little bit from how we've been approaching this so far.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Because they will be focused on specifically\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: engineering work.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: There might be some things of\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I'll say, I'll do x y z.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: We no longer wanna extract, or maybe we just wanna throw away.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. That's on this list, actually.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: We just don't wanna don't wanna extract these.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Then\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: there are definitely gonna be, I think,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: some things that we extract that are\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: just problem statements.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: With no explicit solution.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And the agent needs to figure out how do you test this thing, and then\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: iterate into it is solved.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Versus\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: there's this engineering task that's been defined. Like,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: add a label.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: To\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: ambulating traffic tickets, for example, from our meeting earlier.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: So I I can I can\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: some time to this and\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: come with some more\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: clear criteria?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I think something we were talking about earlier last week was the idea that we don't really need, like, we don't necessarily need to put all of those details into the ticket. Like, can't the Asia just take the ticket and run with it if it has access to corporate contacts, in which case you don't. Need to actually see the ticket with all of the stuff that it should look at.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I think this is still an open question in my mind.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I think one thing we've saw seen the last week\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: from our experiments on the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: kind of\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: end of the VibeWork loop is a higher quality ticket has a really big impact on\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: the quality of the agent executing.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And I think it's also\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: gives us something concrete to focus on of\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: just make a good artifact that then a human could take on\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: an agent could take on.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: As much as we can do it upstream,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I agree with you. Like, theoretically, an agent should be able to find all the right details.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Kinda think making that goalie tickets will be easier for us to work on.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: But I'm\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: not set in stone.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Maybe the way you want to do it is when you create a ticket, you have a pointer to the artifact that created it.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah. I think ultimately,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: we just need all the right context there to be there for the agent when it is trained to\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And how does it\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: verify and understand this problem.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Whether that's pointers or the ticket itself.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I feel like it actually\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: decide that implementation detail right now.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Up.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: For what it's worth, we worked on making good tickets for humans as part of Triage Bot.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: So that's in, like, the triage agent strategy prompt.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: And then we use like, Ask Agent as part of.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: That.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And, anecdotally, do you think it's a lot better for humans?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think it's, like, infinitely better. I think the tickets\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: extraction extracts are, like, three lines with no details, and then the ones with from TriageBot are, like,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And, like,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: all this stuff.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think I think one, like, baseline that we can do right now and that's just no regret is\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: have some prompt where it tries to extract some details.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Rather\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah. If it's as easy as\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: copying and pasting the prompt from somewhere else in the good base,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: that feels very worthwhile.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. I don't I don't know whether it'll be enough.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think that's we can definitely just start there.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yep. I think my answer to your original question Johnny has to share eval go further is probably just. No need. Just vibe it for now.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Think maybe that's what I'll work on today then is\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: run some maybe an attractive tickets and triage tickets through coding agents and\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: try to\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: develop a stronger stance on\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: where is the prompt\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: or where are the tickets\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: where where are more details needed in the ticket to be for the code agent to execute them successfully.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah. I think I'll I'll I'll work on that.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Four.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And we just can vibe it for now.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: It would be nice if you added code for that and if it involves ask agent for that to be separate from the current loop that we have for evals. Because whenever you evolve ASC agent, it makes the eval loop extremely slow, as you guys might know.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Because right now it's pretty fast. We're just making tool calls.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah. That makes sense. I think a lot of this one will see just be\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: me copy pasting and trying it and editing the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: editing the ticket manually.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: To develop a sense.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Then seeing if that's\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: prompt tunable.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. And then Kumal is eval for.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Slack meetings.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Meetings.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Is the thing that Karen wrote actually sufficient? Do we not need date filters?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: me let me just try to write the the datasets and then see see what I need.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: If I need things, I'll build it.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Because.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: As soon as someone actually completes any kind of.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Like most meetings don't make sense if the meeting happened a week later, right?\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Two.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: If you take this meeting and then you fed it into our system, like four days from now.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: It's just not going to make any sense because supposedly we actually did the work we talked about.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. I I think I think probably we need some way of, like,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: dumping a linear board state\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: and just, like, having that.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: As the thing as the thing to baseline from.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: We did build this whole system.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Like previously.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: The same system.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: It's the same system, Phillips. So we just copy over what the leaderboard thing we did for Accelerated?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I see.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, cool.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Wait. Hold When when you wanted me to work on evals in the first place,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: what was insufficient about the current system?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Is there anything else I can help you with?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: No, I don't think there was, but I think it's a tricky thing to figure out.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Collecting all the past linear skills and everything.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I see. Wait. So do we have evals for meetings in Slack currently?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: We have.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah, I think we actually do, but.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Wait. Wait.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah, they're in the other exponent code base. I was just working off of ones that I made up.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: If I just if I just pull those over in the state that they're at, what's the problem with them?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Okay. So\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Okay. Fair enough. Fair\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I'll just I'll try to port those over, and if there's, like, things that\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I can tell are wrong with the setup, I'll fix them.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Within corporate context.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Which could be, through your opinion, the corporate context.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. But I think the other problem is I don't think they're comprehensive of the issues that are actually faced, practically.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I I think I I think I understand.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Like there's not a very concrete problem here. The problem here is a lack of clear understanding and direction.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Basically, like, we have something. It's it's unclear whether it's actually testing the things that we needed to test.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: It's\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And part of that might be fixing the framework, part of that might might might just be adding data.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: To make sure we're covering all the cases.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. So I actually would want either Johnny or Karen to also work with Kumail in this problem, because the fundamental problem here is like, an ownership, like someone understands the whole problem problem.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Mhmm.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I mean, yeah, I threw a fake mail on this because I was working on a GitHub quality anyways.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Cool. Basically every single thing in red here.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Like you guys should either believe that it's no longer a problem.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Or it is a problem, like we have a systematic way to work on it.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Everything. That's a quality problem, at least.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Been kind of a theme across.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Our projects. That quality is not owned sufficiently enough.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: I think it's a harder thing to work on.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. And I think the perfect tickets for David would be the things that are more of features. I think they're probably more scoped and they're better onboarding tasks anyway.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah, David can work on getting Notion doc support. It's kind of just copying the existing workflow.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: For notion.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Like, build build a new process for Notion docs.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Well, the thing about the notion docs, though, is you might want to pair them up with, like, a meeting transcript, right?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Maybe kind of tricky.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: If you want to do that.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. That's probably true.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: But he could he could at least get started in in building some kind of notion processor, like,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: have a scaffolding for it with some prompt.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Sounds good.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And I'm a at least familiarize you with how the system works.\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: That makes sense. How would pairing them up be? Tricky, I guess. Someone who knows nothing about.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Well, you need to know that the dock and the meetings are part of the same thing.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And then you also need to write some special prompt, because right now the system just takes in a particular art, like a single artifact, and it makes updates as a result of it.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: It doesn't do, like, batch a bunch of artifacts together. And what is your conclusion as a result of all these things together?\n  - 07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|david r: Right. So it's part like recognizing that as part of the same problem, or part of recognizing or, I guess, grouping by context. And also partially, it's only just used to working with one artifact at a time.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: But I think for now,\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: You can just port over having notion dock updates.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And then I think the other\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: thing that\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: should be reasonable for David to work on is the ingestion race.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: This thing.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: So the the issue here is that right now when we\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: try to create\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: okay, so the way that extraction works is first you go and see what tickets already exist\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: for the task that you're trying to create tickets for, and then you decide whether you want to update them or\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: if you wanna create new tickets. The issue is that we use the\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Grapevine database as the source for\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: for tickets.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And so we often just miss a lot of them because\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: grapevine ingestion takes some time.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And especially if you're doing, like, Slack extraction in a thread and\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: there's, like, multiple quick succession messages in the same thread, we extract the same\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: task, like, three or four times.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And I think the fix here is just to use the linear API\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: in addition.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: strategy. So I think the the thing here is when you use the grapevine search strategy,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: also use\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: the existing linear stuff.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I think this is also partially fixed because in addition to searching either grapevine or linear, we also look at the top 20 most recently updated tickets.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: This is already built in. I'm not sure when it was added, but I saw that that existed.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I see. I don't think it works completely correctly, though.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Or maybe\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah, I agree.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: the top 20 most recent tickets isn't enough or something because I see the\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: like, from today's extractions, there's a bunch of duplicates.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: I think it would be a nice goal if we felt like.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: We could actually get ambient extraction to a good state by the end of the week.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And that the quote in the accuracy was actually very good.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: I wonder how possible do you think that is? There's a lot of things I've read.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: But also some of them are probably are potentially very easy.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah, I feel like we can solve all the red\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: the end of the week.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: It seems very doable.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, but is it going to be doable if.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: It's mostly Karen working on the quality issues.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I I think it depends on how much other work is gonna show up.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Like, if if the scope of all of our work is just this and we just need to eval the quality,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I feel like it should be fine.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: But if we set up evals and then discover there's a bunch of\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: quality issues or, like, as we use ambient extractions, we discover we discover there's more issues than\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I don't think we'll have ambient extraction working by the end of the week.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: If the scope is just the red issues that\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yvan called out, I I think we should be able to\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: I think the problem. I think the problem is actually going to be the evo. So we've supposedly observed these issues in the past.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: But I'm not sure if we're going to be able to capture an eval.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Create. Give the email that captures the issue.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Mhmm.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And labeling eval is also takes a really long time. So even though we created back in the day was hand created the linear state of.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: What should be created. The ground truth is all just like hand labeled. And it took like three whole days or something like that.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Fair enough.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Fair enough.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So I think the eval is actually going to be, like, the toughest part, and we still don't really have.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: A system that creates these evals a lot easier, actually. You know, like, one thing that I think I would have loved to have a long time ago, but we never created. I think we talked about it, but people just didn't get around to it.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Is like you could just pick out an artifact.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And then create, like, an eval data point from it.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So if you saw in Slack like an example of something not getting done right, or someone mentions a meeting they didn't get done right, you could click a button and then it as an eval and then you might still need to write the ground truth, but at least the linear state and the actual output were recorded.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Like, if you guys bring over the Evo that created. That was created in the past, I'm pretty sure actually won't capture most of these issues.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Most of these issues were created as a result of practical things that ended up happening.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: That being said, like, none of these are\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: very complex evals. Right? Like,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: we create\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah, I feel like.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: that that didn't end up in linear.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Like, that that just\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah, I feel like the way that tuned the GitHub issue for talking about work versus the ticket created was I just had Claude come up with what the ticket should be seated and I seeded that ticket in linear and then what the output should have been. I just had Claude do all of that and then I ran. It. It just didn't have. I don't know if that's not representative because it's not actually work related to us like the content and it's harder for us to judge that, but it just made up like BS stuff about some system and whatever.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Like,\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, you know what? Actually, I think Slack messages are a lot easier.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: I think the hard one's meetings, because meetings are so long.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And then it creates, like,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And then you kind of need to read through the transcript to actually figure out.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Reason why or not.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Oh, and then the other thing I was going to say, like, if we add notion docs to this, like, we haven't tested notion docs at all, right?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Right.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think there's probably gonna be a decent amount of iteration that needs to be done on that.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, so the underlying question was.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: For us to try to take a step back and take a look at the potential risks.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And is there anything for us to adjust to make it more likely that we succeed in this week, if not in this week, over time.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Mhmm.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: I think one thing I might put on that is make it easy to add a data point into the eval so in all future cases where we notice issues, we don't run into this thing where like now or many weeks post that issue being seen and we still don't have a good eval for it.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And I think the thing that we call lesterran was like, luckily, a lot of these things are about slack messages, which I think were far easier to create in eval for.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: In fact, I actually like these two things are both already done, right?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And then the the other thing that might be complex is\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Notion docs, but I think we will address that when we\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: address that.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I don't think there's any different action to take right now.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, so potential action.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Advocate for us doing this because I think it would have been smart to do previously. It's still smart to do now.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. I think I think making it easy to add new eval data points based on things we see is\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: yeah. I I\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: this makes sense.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. And then I think the other thing I'm just. I just say is, actually, Karen, I think you should just be the owner for quality. And then you should just pull in like Johnny or Brandon as you realize you need to do more stuff or something like that. I think that's another way we do risk. Is like you're the. You are the owner versus Komal.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Mhmm.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Two.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Because that means wall's gone. You could take actions and pull in more people or whatever you need to do.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. I mean, overall, I think\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Ambien Extraction is your show, Karen, while while I'm out.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Ah, yes, because a van left us.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Because David Evan left us, and and David is ramping up.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Johnny's working on a different part of the problem. So\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: yeah, particularly quality, but I think you own everything at end right now.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: In fact. Okay, one last thing. I think this could.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Not. This is probably not completely representative of older problems that exist in meetings.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: If this is true, then we're saying that meetings are basically at, like, 100%, right? If these are the only two problems we see with them.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Yep.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. I I think\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: this is almost certainly not correct.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think there's there's, like,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: this week, we're gonna find problems with meetings.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I don't think Amy is gonna be 100% at the end of this\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. Actually, one more thing we don't need. We actually care a lot more about.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: False negatives and false positives, actually.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: For the purposes of unblocking other people.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Like if we create extra tickets, that's kind of okay. We just need to make sure we create enough good, high quality tickets for other people that try to one shot with coding agents.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: So you say we shouldn't work on the duplicate tickets issue?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think we should because I think it creates\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I I think false negatives do matter, actually, because what this ends up being is, like,\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: instead of having four high quality PRs to review, there's like\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: 10 things on the list and you're like, what's going on?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I mean, ideally,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: we're not reviewing any of them.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: At the verification loophole.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Wait. Someone's still gonna hit like this. All looks good, right?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And for now, I guess.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I mean I mean, like, the idea was\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: the end of the loop is an agent is posting evidence\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: of their fix.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: So you're looking at you're spending ten seconds on a PR.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: To look at an image\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: and you're good.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah, okay, but you're still spending, like, 10 seconds.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: But\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: I don't think we're cutting that part out anytime soon, right?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: no. I don't think so.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Not anytime soon.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Think we can\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: greatly minimize, like, get\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: pretty pretty low on the amount of effort needed per PR. But\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: if we have three tickets that are all trying to solve the same problem,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: and all three of them succeed,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: That's not the end of the world. I also would expect that maybe not they don't all succeed and that helps us learn about the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: the right ticket format along the way.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: No. It could be worth doing. Mean, not as\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: high priority as other things.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: That was you.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: I think we can. 80, 20. False net, false.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: False positives.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: If we create like a few pulse false positive here and there, it's like.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: We don't to eradicate them.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: But I think false negatives and then also making sure the false negatives have enough context in them.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Is far more important.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yes. I would figure that.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: I feel like anecdotally, we had a false positive problem and not a false idea, so I guess that's good.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah, that's what it sound that sort of felt like, actually. So we might be a lot better off than we realize.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: If we think that we're already 80, 20 on false positives and false negatives are already pretty good.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: What's the step after that, Johnny?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Do you guys?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Then need to manually just try a bunch of tickets and then one day just turn on the flow automatically.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I think that'll inform our next steps.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I would expect that\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: we don't have the right context in them yet.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I just extracted it to get\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: extracting an issue and or sorry. Extracting a task and making sure it's\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: defining clearly enough that an agent could one shot\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: is likely the gap.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay, cool.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So that's what you're working on, and then.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah. I'm gonna try to\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: that out because we still won't actually run it on any imminently extracted\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: tickets.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I don't really know where we're at.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: But then I expect there'll be quality improvements in there.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Cool. I think everything seems in line then.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Exciting. So after we stop this meeting, we're going to get a bunch of ambulate extracted tickets.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I hope so.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: For some reason, the Grapevine QA stand up that happened earlier didn't didn't get a\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Grapevine artifact for it.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Bruh.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: So I haven't haven't seen it work yet.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, okay.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Where do we see where the artifacts are?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I'm just looking in the database.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Is that a, like, connectors issue then?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think this is a connector's issue, I think.\n  - 5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|karen: Are you guys, like, super backed up or something?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Oh, wait. It came through.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Me check.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think it just took a long time to process maybe.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. And so do we have. Maybe we should have a Slack channel also. I think we kind of already had this at some point that posts all the artifacts that created the tickets that got updated.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And then it should just get piped into, like, straight up into linear, right?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So we can just watch our linear boards, too, to see if they're created properly.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Wait. Sorry. Say that again.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So what is our way to keep an eye on if this system is working well?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Right now, it's just looking at the linear boards themselves.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Alright.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Maybe we should slack. I. I remember at some point we had slack channels that slack messages that posted.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: When a meeting happens, as I said, it updates and then posts it say update updates for.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I see. I think that might have gotten lost in porting so I can take a look\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: look at that.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I think that would be helpful to have.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Anecdotally, I'm not seeing any\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: tickets from Grapevine.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Stand up.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Extracted.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. It looks like it did fail.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I will figure out why that happened.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Cool. Okay. I think that's all for today, though.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: You should post when this transcript.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: A process, and we can see how it did.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yep.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Sounds good. One more thing before we break.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Philip you give us\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: update on where project exponent future is at?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Is there anything\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: us?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So what they're working on right now.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Was just on making a seamless to do list personal to list.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And this is what it looks like right now.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And basically the features that's going to have is it syncs with Linear and GitHub as well. So, like, it pulls things in as you. It pulls things into that as exponent of tapestry linear.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So it also depends on that, actually. I guess that's one way that I can see if it's working. Supposedly, this will pull my linear for me, and then it will have, like, a one click to start, like, to start a coding agent.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And then it will also write updates for you.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So this is what the update is right now. But the idea is some teams actually have their Async stand up thing that happens.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And could we make it so that you could literally just copy and paste? This is actually completely accurate.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Actually, wait.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: This is not okay. I think they changed the ui. This is actually not what I was talking about. But they used to have a thing where there's like, it just wrote an update for you as you did work, and then you had like three different buttons of types of conciseness and whatever that it could be.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And basically, I just want them to just ship this to people internally.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: And see if we can create a to list that we think.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: People our people would use instead of whatever they use today because it actually provides enough value.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: The other thing we explored was gamification.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: I think right now we're a little bit of a rut in exploring promising ideas, though. I don't think we're writing it off. I think it's just, like, hard to explore.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: But I don't know, where was your question coming from? Because it is pretty.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: The scope is, like, pretty is, like, a lot smaller nowadays. It's more just around, like, a person. Is there anything interesting to do around a person? To the list, actually.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. The the thing the thing I'm wondering is\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: what does the optimal UI look like for\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: the demo that we're building?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: If we built a project management experience around\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: async agents going off and doing work in the background, like, what does that look like?\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Oh, yeah. Actually, that was one thing that.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Daniel did. Prototype was it was a different UI for.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Reviewing AI work. It wasn't anything crazy. It was just like cards that swipe.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: I see.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I I think for this\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: But, yeah, this is the group. This is the group to explore that if we have more concrete things for them to go after.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Yeah. I don't have any\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: like, particular ideas right now, but I\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: as a prompt, I'm I'm wondering what\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: what there is there.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: For kind of the immediate demo that will\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: do first, I imagine the best UI is just GitHub.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: But that's not necessarily true over time.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah, the best UI probably is.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: GitHub, and you can just have a thing that just gives you a list of GitHub links you need to click.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: One one other question about exponent future.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Is this what both Brad and Daniel are working on?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: What you described, Philip?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Because\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I saw Brad just posted, like, a\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: end to end verification loop, very similar to the stuff that Brent and I are doing.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I don't if there's some, like,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: duplication effort there.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah. This is what they're both working on. You might have done something that you guys also did.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: So maybe.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I guess, we're we're doing ambient extraction. They're doing\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: the task created in the app.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: So the the input's a little bit different, but other than that, it's the same.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Yeah, okay. Anyway, I think.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: I can get some context on this, on the work that you guys have already been doing. I think he just doesn't know that you guys have been working on this.\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Okay. I think we're good now, though.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Cool. Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: So\n  - f0518383-55e5-4181-8fe2-3c60fb64fc13|phillip: Cool. All right, see you guys.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: This\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Karen,\n\n\nChat Messages:\n\n2025-12-01T18:00:33.945+00:00 <@5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|@karen>: o yay the auto recording worked\n2025-12-01T18:00:38.205+00:00 <@df601bb6-6d7e-449a-8658-41780e6c17aa|@evangeline>: woop woop\n2025-12-01T18:00:46.785+00:00 <@df601bb6-6d7e-449a-8658-41780e6c17aa|@evangeline>: woahhhh\n2025-12-01T18:00:55.249+00:00 <@07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|@david r>: ceramics studio??\n2025-12-01T18:01:00.123+00:00 <@df601bb6-6d7e-449a-8658-41780e6c17aa|@evangeline>: omg\n2025-12-01T18:01:05.103+00:00 <@df601bb6-6d7e-449a-8658-41780e6c17aa|@evangeline>: LOL\n2025-12-01T18:01:18.009+00:00 <@df601bb6-6d7e-449a-8658-41780e6c17aa|@evangeline>: rachel running her own lil sweatshop\n2025-12-01T18:02:05.481+00:00 <@5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|@karen>: omg goodbye :wave:\n2025-12-01T18:02:11.276+00:00 <@07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|@david r>: taking this personally\n2025-12-01T18:02:46.300+00:00 <@df601bb6-6d7e-449a-8658-41780e6c17aa|@evangeline>: ok LOL\n2025-12-01T18:03:50.829+00:00 <@5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|@karen>: wait so specifically getting internal adaptation first and the demo video as a secondary goal?\n2025-12-01T18:10:55.672+00:00 <@5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|@karen>: the humanoid robot video\n2025-12-01T18:10:56.293+00:00 <@5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|@karen>: lmao\n2025-12-01T18:16:47.340+00:00 <@07b084d9-6eab-410e-bad8-2bdfc900b4d0|@david r>: will also be part time on exponent this week as I move off of payments\n2025-12-01T18:32:33.488+00:00 <@5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|@karen>: need more alex lius to grind evals\n2025-12-01T18:32:39.035+00:00 <@0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|@JohnnyD>: need an alex liu pt 2\n2025-12-01T18:53:10.217+00:00 <@cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|@Kumail>: does ambient set assignees right now?\n2025-12-01T18:53:20.032+00:00 <@5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|@karen>: it should\n2025-12-01T18:53:25.761+00:00 <@cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|@Kumail>: nice\n2025-12-01T18:53:29.970+00:00 <@5286e8d4-e5dc-4bad-b08d-4d0227c18a13|@karen>: but sometimes it fails to find an owner but it could be my local setup lol",

Chandler reported that HubSpot-related Slack spam is 99 % resolved and is opening and triaging issues for remaining errors. Johnny described parallel work on both a many-stage and two-stage agent pipeline and will circulate Adam’s forthcoming one-pager for broader feedback. Vic outlined this week’s focus on improving Review Bot quality and plans to integrate it into Gather-tom v2 and corporate codebases, with a follow-up sync scheduled for later today. Jordan will complete the shared documentation asynchronously, and Jordan & Brent continue automating pipeline runners.\n\nNotes:\n\nConnector Installations Migration:\n  - All installations consolidated into new polymorphic table (connector_installations)\n  - Legacy per-connector tables (Slack, GitHub, Linear, HubSpot, Trello) slated for removal\n  - Jordan updating deletion script accordingly\n\nStaging / Gather Issues:\n  - Staging felt unstable for some; no blocking problems reproduced\n  - HubSpot Slack spam largely fixed; new error-group noise remains\n  - Chandler creating and triaging issues for residual errors\n\nPipeline & Agent Strategy:\n  - Running two approaches in parallel: many-stage vs two-stage pipelines\n  - Goal is eventual convergence; Jordan & Brent working on automated runners\n  - Adam preparing a one-pager to detail plan; Johnny to share\n\nReview Bot Roadmap:\n  - Focus this week on quality tuning and thresholds per category (performance, security, reliability, etc.)\n  - Integration planned for Gather-tom v2 and corporate repos\n  - Vic, Andy, Dave to regroup later today to assess progress\n\nAction Items:\n  - description='Fill out shared doc asynchronously' due_date=None assignee='Jordan'\n  - description='Delete legacy per-connector installation tables after migration verification' due_date=None assignee='Jordan'\n  - description='Create and triage issues for remaining error-group noise' due_date=None assignee='Chandler'\n  - description='Schedule afternoon sync for Review Bot progress (Vic, Andy, Dave)' due_date=None assignee='vic'\n  - description='Share Adam’s one-pager on pipeline strategy with full team' due_date=None assignee='JohnnyD'\n\nTranscript:\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Well, I guess. Should we just fill out the doc? Async.\n  - 0a1ce2ec-17df-47dd-a349-85eacb0aa44c|Andy: Cool.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Sounds good.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Yeah.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I'll\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Something going on with staging. I feel like it took me a while to get in. Took me a couple tries.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I'll fill out the doc.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): That was weird.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: One thing that came up\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Thought I was but me double check. Just us?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: The break. But\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: do you have a sense of how you imagine this\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: up\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: while I was working on something else, Chandler, is that\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I think\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: we started with the pattern of\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: adding the installations\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: in the ControlDB.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: And I don't think that's that.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: So\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: He? Oh, let me double check.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Good call out.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Oh, you did.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, no. I set it up for gong.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: It, does it?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yes.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Nice.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Is there a a connector stable, or is it\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: wait. Is it a single table? Or\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: per connector?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: It's a single table now. Yep.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Okay.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So it's a new polymorphic table for all connector installations.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Alright. Makes sense. Because I was writing this\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: deletion script, and I I was looking at all these tables that were showing up.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah. Those tables are going to go away. The other ones.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Like the HubSpot installations.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Yeah.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Let me double check this one.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Deletion.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: And then load diff.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Let me look at the tables to check.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Where was this one?\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Yeah. So we had Slack, GitHub, Linear, HubSpot, Trello.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: But now we just have the connector installations.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yep, that's right.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Did you migrate everyone that already exists?\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I already\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yep. Everyone's been migrating.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: okay. So I only actually need\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: to look at that table. I can remove the others.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Okay.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yep.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Makes sense.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Is it\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Hey. Feel like staging was acting a little weird today.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Maybe there was, like, a bad deploy or something.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah, it's working okay for me.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: That's weird.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Do you mean gather or\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: break fly?\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Oh, yeah, sorry. I mean, gather.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Johnny. So what is Garden's two stage agent pipeline like? What is he up to now?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Trying to find that work really today.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: He was out last week and was out yesterday, so we haven't had a chance to talk since.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Go.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I think generally,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: there's a sense of the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: end to end vibe work\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: approach that we're doing that joining Reds and I are working on.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: We're calling kind of many stage pipeline.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: It's kind of linear, but we have these, like,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: ticket created\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: then assigned to cursor,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: iterate,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: then verify. It kind of assumes that this is a linear process.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Which isn't very accurate to to reality.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Okay?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: You learn something in the process of building it that changes the typical requirements or\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: you try something, you verify it the wrong way, yada yada. You can kinda\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: K. Is much simpler. Just\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: have an agent that has a tool, ability to do everything.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And loops until it can, a, reproduce the problem and then\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: know how to reproduce the problem.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Like, kind of step back and forth across this pipeline.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: We're kind of trying both of these in parallel, pipeline and two stage pipeline.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And I think they're gonna search\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: converge more and more.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Still building building blocks for the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Medisave pipeline.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yep. I'll have more specific thing. Think Adam just got a one pager he wants to share with me, and\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: then\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: we'll we'll share with everybody.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Describes you some more depth.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Okay?\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): For many stage pipelines should.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Like. Okay. I mean, I guess for now. Human executes verification prompt is. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Okay, cool.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And there's an open question on, like,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: and this is actually a loop also.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Are all kind of, like,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: they loop within themselves.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: But\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: probably, your your review bot stuff plugs in here somewhere.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Where\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Rex, you're reviewing it.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: That reexecutes the code, iterates, iterates.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I think that's kind of what we're gonna go up for v three, but we haven't designed it yet.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Yeah.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool. Makes sense.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Oh, Chandler. Was all the channel spam like HubSpot?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: It was like, 99% HubSpot.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Oh wow, it does look better. Now. There is still a lot of the new error group thing, but otherwise the other stuff is all gone. That's cool.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Nice.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I am actively creating issues for all the other stuff.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then triaging them.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Sweet.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Sweet. Thanks, man.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah, not a problem.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): So on the reviewer side, we are just doing basically what I said we're doing in the Slack channel yesterday afternoon. I think we're going to work on that a bit and then we're just going to regroup, the three of us, later this afternoon to see where we're at and see what's next, I think roughly.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): This week is just going to look like we think it's going to look just iterating on quality stuff and then maybe towards the end of the week setting up the plumbing to get all of the actual review bot stuff hooked up in gather top V2.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): So pretty straightforward. Anything you guys want to talk about or share, Johnny?\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Anything new today?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: One question maybe for the review bot stuff.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Two questions. One, are you guys only doing Guided Town, or are you doing corporate contacts as\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: well?\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): We? I guess. You know, we should hook it up for corporate projects, too. No reason not to.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): We just have been primarily testing with gather tom v2 and our eval set is Gattavi too.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): So I think it makes sense to test with corporate context too, though.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): We can always turn it off and whatever.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And two, it's kinda like\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: fitting into the whole vibe work?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Vision?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Like,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: or do you think this doesn't?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Is this just a\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: about coding use cases corporate context?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Or who would be thinking about how it plays\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Yeah, I think it does. I think it does, but it doesn't necessarily have to. I am actually kind of see this similar to the. To that time when we worked on Fast Grade Fund, where, like, it's kind of just a tool. I think it'll be useful in a bunch of different scenarios, I think. Vivework is one of them. I think one of the other ones that I mentioned to some people, including you yesterday, Johnny, was like,\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): You know, like, you can imagine this just like slotting into Devin somewhere. Like, if they wanted it. This should just be like an easy thing, like an easy proof of concept of, like, look, if you take our thing, you take our output and you apply these filters to it, like, it's just a pretty cut and dry. Like, it's just a quality improvement on Devin for, like, XYZ scenarios. And maybe they're kind of edge case scenarios, but, like, you know, that kind of stuff matters. And you can imagine it, like, mattering more for bigger enterprises, bigger data sets, but for something like vibr.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): I think basically the output that you should expect from.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Grapevine reviewer is an array of comments that each have some kind of comment body and of course, the path in the line and stuff. But also each have an impact assessment, like an impact number, a confidence number, and then a category including a possible other category. But there's some categories along the lines of performance, security, reliability, type stuff.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): And the thinking is that if this was a standalone reviewer product, you might want to be able to do stuff like set different thresholds for different kinds of categories, like when to post certain things. Maybe you want certain orgs to be able to adjust their use sliders to set their own thresholds for certain things. Maybe they think Review Bot is too noisy for certain types of stuff, but we're hoping that this granularity can also be useful in other places, and I think it probably should be.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): But yeah, I think the obvious review bot slotting into vibe work is just as some steps somewhere in verification.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah. Okay. Cool. That makes sense.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: It would be interesting. I I I could see that one point at some point being maybe it's a tool.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: That our agent has if we do the the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: two stage pipeline.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Nextiva review, kinda progress PRs or local code two.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah. You take notes.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Yeah, I told a loop with. Yeah, that kind of makes sense.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah. I think kinda similar for us\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: There's just work to do this week.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: We'll see where the Gotham stuff lands.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I think the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: immediate next step for our many shape pipeline is we're gonna have it run automatically.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: So Jordan and Brent are working on making it\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: begin runners.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Using browser based.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: We'll actually just again, easy browser tools are.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Continues to surprise. While I'm\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: familiar with exponent,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: to make ambient attraction high quality.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): All right. I think we can wrap it a little early today. Anything else to anything else anyone wants to talk about?\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool. Andy and Dave. I'll put something on the calendar for us later, but see.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: Cool. See everybody?\n",

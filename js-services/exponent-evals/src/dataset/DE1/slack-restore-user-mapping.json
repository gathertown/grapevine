FWIW it looks like this only worked for slack in the past and not meetings\\n[2025-12-02T17:21:37.540Z] Evangeline: yeppp. some reasons why we added this:\\n• we saw a quality bump when we used actual names in the input, instead of user ids. i'm not exactly sure why because names and ids should serve as the same unique identifiers, but it felt like the agent was getting less confused over who's doing what\\n• after adding the mapping we were getting the assignee correct 90% of the time, so i would still recommend mapping ids across every input exponent is ambiently extracting from\\n[2025-12-02T19:03:49.131Z] Karen Ying: @David something you can also look into as a rampup port task!\\n\\n=== New messages since last pass (process these) ===\\n[2025-12-02T22:25:50.980Z] Karen Ying: oh lol @David i just realized this is messing up quality a lot so imma fix this today since you're working on other stuff so no worries\"\n}",

Jonathas is debugging the webhook refactor, advancing OAuth/admin updates, and aims to finish artifact-definition docs by Friday; the group agreed it is acceptable to ship apps with the “unapproved” banner for now. Konrad cleaned up Asana auth UX and is adding Zendesk article syncing with rate-limiting while preparing the Asana Marketplace submission. Chandler’s focus this week is slashing alert noise and implementing new health checks—including webhook-failure monitoring—while migrating installation tables and instrumentation. Ciro submitted the Intercom app for marketplace approval, will fix a small PR conflict, polish UI copy, and then pick items from the backlog. Key unresolved items are final testing of the webhook refactor and coordinating Snowflake setup UX between Chandler and Jonathas.\n\nNotes:\n\nWebhook Refactor & Integrations:\n  - Jonathas investigating HubSpot/Gmail/Linear errors after reverting refactor\n  - New PR opened; will merge to staging for further testing\n  - Need health checks on webhook failures (Chandler ticketed)\n\nMarketplace Apps & Connectors:\n  - Intercom app submitted for approval; screenshots/video recorded\n  - Asana Marketplace submission pending screenshots (Konrad)\n  - Acceptable to list apps with red “not approved” banner temporarily\n\nAsana & Zendesk Enhancements:\n  - Asana auth UI now routes users based on subscription/service-account availability\n  - Zendesk Help Center article sync in progress; will reuse ticket backfill and add request rate limiting\n\nAlerts & Health Checks:\n  - Chandler aiming to reduce alert noise to near zero this week\n  - Admin-UI health checks and PostHog instrumentation being updated\n  - Webhook-failure checks to be added\n\nDocumentation & Testing:\n  - Artifact-definition documentation targeted for 90–100 % completion by Friday\n  - Ciro running end-to-end tests on Intercom; will verify Grapevine UI copy\n  - Snowflake connector now appears in installations table\n\nCoordination & Scheduling:\n  - Snowflake setup UX discussion to be scheduled today (Chandler & Jonathas)\n  - Ciro to ping Chandler after lunch to select backlog tickets\n\nAction Items:\n  - description='Merge webhook-refactor PR to staging and run additional tests; revert if issues persist' due_date=None assignee='Jonathas'\n  - description='Complete artifact-definition documentation' due_date=None assignee='Jonathas'\n  - description='Ping Chandler and schedule Snowflake setup UX discussion' due_date=None assignee='Jonathas'\n  - description='Implement webhook-failure health checks' due_date=None assignee='Chandler'\n  - description='Reduce alerts-channel noise to near zero this week' due_date=None assignee='Chandler'\n  - description='Finish admin-UI health checks and update PostHog instrumentation' due_date=None assignee='Chandler'\n  - description='Craft screenshots and submit Asana Marketplace listing' due_date=None assignee='konrad'\n  - description='Complete Zendesk Help Center article sync with built-in rate limiting' due_date=None assignee='konrad'\n  - description='Resolve conflict and merge PR to master' due_date=None assignee='Ciro'\n  - description='Verify Grapevine UI copy for Intercom setup and adjust as needed' due_date=None assignee='Ciro'\n\nTranscript:\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: What?

The youngest one is far. He's fine, man. He went to school, like, by himself and.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: He's got that toddler immune system.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Oh, yeah, yeah.

Didn't sleep super well last night, but that's okay.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: How old is you? I forgot.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: He's eight months.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Eight months.

Like, oh, it's tough.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Just endure.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yes.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Ooh, I like your mug. It's cool.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Oh, it's like Grandma's mike, right?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, I see, I see.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah, it's free.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Nice. Okay. At first I thought it was, like, a Japanese stencil or something.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Oh, no, man. It's just ideas. We just bought.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Nice.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Wow.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: That's crazy. I like it.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Man, we have so many mugs here, like ears and ears and ears of traveling around, traveling around and getting mugs. And then people come over and we have Secret Santa and there is maybe one or two mugs this year. We have maybe like 30 or 35 different mugs. It's cool, man. It's very nice. Yeah. When you get older, like, it's a very nice thing to get as a present. Like, works because you are always, like, drinking tea or coffee or even water on wax. Right. It's cool.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah, or soup. You never know.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Soup.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Right.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Or maybe yogurt. Like some weird people just put some yogurt here and mix with.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: It's funny. We have a set of little. They're kind of like little mugs, but they don't really function as mugs, so we just use them as, like, little snack bowls. So it's like little apples, chips, pretzels, whatever in a mug.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Nice.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Farm mugs. They failed on their only function they had in this world.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: If.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Be a mug. No.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Kit.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah. If you saw them, you'd be like. Because it's almost like a little bowl, but it has a handle and it's not mug sized. I don't know what's going on with them, but we do not use them as mugs.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Like a big latte mug.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: You know?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, really?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Wow.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: It's not, like, super wide either. It's almost the proportions you'd expect a mug to me, but it's, like, a little bit shorter and.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I don't know.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Interesting.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: So it's. They're weird, though, Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: All right.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Might have to share.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: You'd be like. If you got a cup of coffee served in it, you'd be like, that's not enough coffee.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Nice.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Jonathan's. You doing good today?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Stop.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: We can see your mouse nerving.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Can you hear me now?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yes, we got you.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: It's not working anymore.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I need to get to a new one.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: So yesterday I actually had tried to fix the webhook refactory.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Refactor that I made, and I was kind of investigating the issues, and after I revert, the HubSpot, like, kind of arrow was still happening, so I don't think maybe it's related.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Also the gmail one.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I'm not super sure either.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: The linear might be.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I did some fix. I opened a new pr. Not sure if anyone wants to deploy anything soon. If not, I will merge your staging and do some more testing.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: If it. I still see something weird.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I will likely revert again.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But I cannot, like, replicate exactly. But I also lose loose ends that I kind of could be potentially something or something that I was kind of maybe missing.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I did some updates there.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And then I start like add to implementation especially on the oauth and I end up like doing the whole admin and back in front end as well. So I open a PR for that.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And now I'm working on documenting artifacts. Definition.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: So maybe by Friday.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Most of this is going to be done. Let's see how it goes.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I think after everything is more like in their own page.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I think doing new connectors seems to be a bit faster now.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: So I'm expecting that at least, like, 90% of the code competition by Friday, maybe more, let's say.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Man.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: How excited I will be to hit the 100% by the week.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: This is crazy.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And maybe next week, like midnight.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I saw that if we want to submit, like the Marketplace app, it takes one to two days, so it might even align with that.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But also I noticed that they also let you authenticate with out even if it's not applied. But they put like a big red banner saying it's not yet approved, so maybe we want banner even.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And just wait.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: That's totally fine. Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I think that's totally fine, to be honest, because we have a couple of apps that are already like that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And like our Slack app is like that, for example.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Because it's not approved.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: But obviously we want to try to get it approved as soon as possible.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Yeah. Are you guys seeing the connecting banner next to everyone?\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Oh, my God. I guess I lost connection.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So you guys list John Thyston.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Oh, now I'm back.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Welcome back.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I mean, what happened?\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Wow. That's it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Any question Channel.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: No. Yeah. Made me think of we need to add to health checks for if there's webhook failures.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: We don't currently do that on webhook failures.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So I just made a ticket for that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Because.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I forgot to mention I was talking with Sam yesterday on the Snowflake front.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, cool.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And he didn't find any issues. So he was mainly playing around and having fun. It seems to be.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: That's great. Yeah.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Yeah. He didn't have any inputs on the snowflake itself, like the core data stuff.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: That's all, man.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Love it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: It's exciting that at IO could get done into this week early next week.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: That's huge.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Yeah.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Let's do it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: All right.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Conrad, do you want to go next?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah, sure. So yesterday I spent some time cleaning up the asana auth ui just to.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: More smartly push someone down the like. Okay, you have a service account versus okay, you're going to need to oauth paths, so that's a lot clearer now. We did it based on choose your asana subscription level so you don't even have to know if you have access to service accounts. Or not. And then it, like, links out to the place you would create it. And then I started on syncing articles for Zendesk, like Help Desk articles. And that should be pretty quick to finish up, I think. I'm like, I've got kind of all the models there and the API endpoints there. And I'm just hooking it up to the sync and going to run it and then fix all the bugs that pop out, and then it should be good. I think I'm just piggybacking the ticket stuff because it's like, we could split it into two separate syncs, but I think right now, we're, like, syncing one week at a time. Ish. And so putting it in that same backfill means we get control over the request, concurrency and all that sort of stuff, which it's very easy to. It's not very easy, but it's quite. It's like easy. To 429Zendesk if you want to.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: See in which I might Also the thing I did for Asana where I put the request rate limiting on our end.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I might retroactively add that to Zendesk as well, because now that we'll have more stuff operating in parallel, that might crop up.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Sweet.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah, that should be me today. If I finish that up and have time. I'm going to work on getting the Asana Marketplace submission going. I just need to craft some nice looking screenshots and then submit those. And I might have an appointment this afternoon, so if so, I'll work in the morning.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Go to appointment work in the evening. That'll be kind of my schedule for today.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah, that's it for me.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Sounds great.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah. Chandler, have you gone yet?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Not yet.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay, so handling a bunch of just little piddly on call issues as normal. My goal for this week is to get the alerts channel down too, as close to zero noise as possible.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay, so handling a bunch of just little piddly on call issues as normal. My goal for this week is to get the alerts channel down too, as close to zero noise as possible.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So that way, next on call person actually is investigating each thing.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then we're either suppressing it or resolving it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: But anyways.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So other than that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I did get a PR out there for migrating away from the old installation tables.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then didn't quite have enough time to finish up the health check stuff for the admin ui.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So I'm going to work on that today. And there's a variety of other things around that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Like post hog instrumentation.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I want to get that updated now that we have the new connector installations table. Jonathan oh, also a note. I did add Snowflake to that connector installations table now, so when somebody sets up Snowflake, it will show up there.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So that is added.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And I think all the other integrations have this. Now, the way that I'm planning that will actually enforce this in the future.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Is I've got another ticket out there for doping credentials to the connector id.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And we're kind of like, walking towards that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And that will be like how we guarantee that. Okay, there is actually a connector installation.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: For every legit connector.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So anyways, that's kind of where we're walking towards.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I think once it's all in Python, it'll be like, oh, fastapi middleware that does the thing for all the connection creations.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yes.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: That defers to each specific connector to do the specific logic.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: 100% yes.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: We will live in such a nice world in, like, six to 12 months.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Well, I hope it's less than that.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Man, these things always drag us on.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Okay, three to six. That's the best I can do.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Eight.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: They do always drag on, but I hope it's not that long. Three to six. Man, I've opened like first of the year. We're vibing, we're jamming.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I tell you what. We'll all take Christmas break. Like a vacation. You can work straight through.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: That's right. Oh, my goodness.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Well, sooner rather than later. Yes. Three to six months. You're odd. That's the mark to beat. All right, sir. I'll wrap this up.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Cool.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Things from my side. Where are you notion?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Oh, gosh. Sorry about that.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yep, here it is.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yesterday created a pull request without the code cleanup that I was planning to do address it. Chandler's suggestions. Thanks for approving that. I noticed that there is a small.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Conflict over there, I would just get it fixed and merge it to master right now. Also, yesterday we submitted Intercoms app to Marketplace approval, so I had to record a video and take screenshots on Rad. It really sucks, man. It's very annoying that we have to do this kind of things, right? Why screenshots, man. It's like nobody really cares. I mean, if you want to connect something, it's just there. I don't know why they ask these kind of things, right?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I might message you to ask questions like just what you use to screen record and stuff.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Also, my voice is so weird. I don't know how you guys bear to hear me all the time. Because it's so weird to hear myself in a video. It's weird.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, no.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: It's completely weird. My voice is so, so weird when I listen to. Anyways also like that's pretty much it. Like from yesterday today. I'm still running a few tests, like end to end testing, but I don't see any bugs. Everything seems to be fine. I just want to double sure that we are good with an intercom code. So, like, you know, the clients, they start to test stuff and they don't get back to us with, like, issues and things that we are supposed to catch on. The testing phase.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: One little thing that I'm gonna do today is just double check the documentation on the Grapevine UI as well. You know when we have like the intercom icon and you click and say like setup connection. I think there is some hard coded text over there that I just like ignored so far. So I will just like, take a look how things look over there. And after that channel, I think I'm gonna start helping with the backlog things like pick up the issues and start working on that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Let's go.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Amazing.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah, that's pretty much it from my side.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool. Do you want to just ping me when you're ready to take some of that stuff on?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah, I will just have some lunch. Give me, like, maybe two hours or something. I'm gonna ping you, then we can chat.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah. Take your time. Sounds good, man.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool. Oh, Jonathan, that's one thing.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I forgot about is we should chat about this snowflake setup. UX today. Just let me know.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: When would be a good time for you?\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Yeah.

Let me just emerge some stuff from Latio.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Because you cause a lot of conflict with my branch.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And then I will.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I will open you.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Sounds good.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Thanks.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: See, guys?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Bye, guys.\n\n\nChat Messages:\n\n2025-12-03T18:00:54.187+00:00 <@346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|@Chandler>: hellooo\n2025-12-03T18:03:29.420+00:00 <@346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|@Chandler>: <https://www.notion.so/gathertown/Grapevine-Connector-Standup-2bebc7eac3d1806b94d5df82be59cb60?source=copy_link>\n2025-12-03T18:16:55.821+00:00 <@346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|@Chandler>: loom\n2025-12-03T18:16:58.479+00:00 <@346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|@Chandler>: very good\n2025-12-03T18:17:13.841+00:00 <@369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|@konrad>: when I hear my own voice I think the same\n2025-12-03T18:17:17.565+00:00 <@369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|@konrad>: I think its a self-awareness thing",

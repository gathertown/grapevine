  "content": "phillip: Yeah.\n\nevangeline: Identity, Sarah. So I was looking at. Actually, I kind of posted my update in Project Exponent.\n\nevangeline: I'm probably not going to enumerate it. I'm going to assume everyone read my post, but I was hoping that it's one of the things we can nail down. This then.\n\nJohnnyD: Yeah, I think that's probably more important technical decisions to make right now.... Happy to talk to it.... Glitter ones. Update first.\n\nevangeline: I can. Popcorn to johnny.\n\nJohnnyD: Sure thing. On my side, working through the eval specifically focused on trying to get tasks in place. There are some changes from Brent Navan over the weekend. Those are great helpful. But this code base got a couple weird things merged in where we had same prompt in three different places. So honestly, I think I've spent most of my day fighting those fires so that I can actually work on clearly solving the task eval. So I've been working through those with Philip.\n\nJohnnyD: Yeah.... So that's the main thing I'm working on.\n\nphillip: Yeah, I've just been making prompt updates. I think we're getting closer, but I think there's a chance that.\n\nphillip: We'll hit a wall and don't really have a way to improve from there. So I think two.\n\nphillip: I think the trickiest thing is I don't think I really understand when something's a subtask.\n\nphillip: Of another. In fact, it may be kind of hard for a third party to actually evaluate that.\n\nphillip: Because we have a lot more context on what we mean when we say set up new Grapevine tenant.... And maybe.\n\nphillip: This is where corp context actually comes. This maybe is where we add back the MCP is It would use that to understand what it means by tenant and then. Yeah, so anyway.\n\nphillip: I kind of wished that I could have a yes or no answer as to if we feel like we can solve this eval using simple stuff by now, but I think we'll have it by the end of the day.... We just keep tweaking.... Until it feels like we're not making progress.\n\nevangeline: Josh, Dylan's got tape.\n\nevangeline: Do you want to give an update next?\n\nevangeline: Maybe brat next.\n\nBrad: Yeah, I can forgot what Cough canyon is. Sex. I think I'm going to do a lot of talking and I'm a bit sick. Been working with Daniel on kind of zooming out and thinking about what project management software may look like in this age of AI. So thinking beyond kind of just an integration with linear.... And thinking like what?\n\nBrad: What we can do now that we couldn't do in the past. Because LINEAR was perhaps designed to look like a successor to jira, with better design, better execution and.\n\nBrad: We can add some automations on top of that, for sure, but we can also kind of think about what does this look like more broadly, what might this process look like more broadly in the future? And that's kind of where we've been ideating a little bit. So once we're all done with status. I can talk through some of our thoughts so far and see if anything resonates with a group, if there's anything that we want to kind of zoom into and maybe try poking at or building or if there are any areas that we want to dismiss as well.\n\nBrad: And I'm going to go grab a cough candy. Still listening, though.\n\ndaniel: Yeah, for me, I would say it's basically the same as Brad.... Yeah. Nothing else.\n\nevangeline: Okay. In that case, let's do the design explorations once Brad is back, and then after that, we can, I guess, especially engineers can stay back to talk about the eval.\n\nBrad: Sounds good.... Okay?\n\nBrad: So what we've been.\n\nBrad: Yeah. What we've been thinking is a few different things.\n\nBrad: So one of the main questions that we don't necessarily need to answer now, but something that we should form an opinion on is do we care?... About the defensibility.\n\nBrad: Or durability of a solution that's built on something like linear exclusively? Or are we interested in.\n\nBrad: A broader approach to project management. Knowing that.... We could face some of the same challenges that we faced with Gather.\n\nBrad: In that there's a large feature set to tackle for even like a minimum viable project management system. But. Yeah, go ahead, Philip.\n\nphillip: I think we should consider ourselves having very little constraints right now.\n\nphillip: Because there's a good chance. I feel like a lot of the. Unlike with Gather, I think there's a good chance that a lot of the features built that linear built are irrelevant in the new age.\n\nphillip: In which cases like proper disruption rather than in the past, we had to just straight up clone a lot of features, which was annoying.\n\nBrad: Agree 100%. Yeah, I think irrelevant is a good way to put it.\n\nBrad: Sort of task managers or ticketing systems of the past required so much detail and context and manual organization that they did just get neglected and kind of atrophy in the ways that we've all witnessed. And that felt like one of the underlying principles of this project was trying to tackle that head on. So what we've tried to do is kind of take the core entities and distill them down to what we would need.\n\nBrad: Representation for. So, like, projects are a thing, tasks are a thing. Of course, features are things. Maybe two levels of hierarchy where you have, like, tasks.\n\nBrad: And and features that live above them. But we also think that nominating or promoting requirements to being a first class document is something that would help facilitate a lot of interesting things. So requirements we see like being checked into repos at times, or maybe they're a separate file. But the notion of having requirements that are constantly referenced with your features and your. Your tasks that are being executed and seeing where they may differ.\n\nBrad: And being able to automatically update requirements based on discussions from transcripts, meetings, slot conversations, etc. Is something that's pretty interesting.... Too. So with that preamble, I'll share my screen.... And talk through some of the stuff that we've been sketching.\n\nBrad: So some of the ideas why existing tools fail.\n\nBrad: That I think we've talked about. But I'll reiterate here. So manual management and SaaS updates create overhead.\n\nBrad: There are fragmented requirements and decisions. I think this is something that we downplay or maybe haven't talked about a ton in this particular project thus far. But requirements are all over the place. Anything that resembles a product requirements doc is frequently out of date immediately, and then there's just a stream of tickets with no real sense if, like, the tickets actually map back to requirements or not, if they're essentialist or not, if they should be prioritized or they shouldn't. Which ones are interdependent or related to one another.\n\nBrad: And decisions as well. So decisions, we should be having a decision log of source and those should feedback into requirements so that we have something to reference our tickets and features against. Otherwise it's just like it's all just noise deleted. Insights into proactive planning. Like that's something too. And then there's just generally high configuration complexity, which all of us have felt with tools like linear, especially.\n\nBrad: Some of the first principles, then, in what a solution could look like is unifying all these project artifacts into a single source of truth. Um, the immediate thing that comes to mind with this is.\n\nBrad: This XK CD of how standards proliferate. I hope you've all seen this before.... But it definitely feels this way in some regard.\n\nBrad: But hopefully one of the differences in this new AI first age is that a new standard can be extremely simple and mostly a read only representation of data or a reflection of existing data that's out there in the ether from other integration sources, rather than it being a discrete source of truth itself.... We want to minimize manual overhead through AI automation, of course.\n\nBrad: Another thing that I just touched on was treating requirements, decisions and tasks as first class objects. Requirements and decisions, especially.... Are maybe less commonly captured in tools like linear and similar.\n\nBrad: And then designing for extensibility. So we're talking about a lot of this in a software engineering context, but.... Think ideally.... A solution of this sort transcends industry.\n\nBrad: And it would apply to home building as well, which also has project managers, which also has task tractors, which also has so many of these similar things that are going to look a little bit different in the age of AI. Maybe there's not agents completing as many home building tasks as there are in software, but there's still all the same problems, and that's in a lot of different industries.\n\nBrad: So at a really high level, what some of these flows may look like is.... This is.\n\nBrad: Extremely low fidelity and predicated that a project exists already. So we haven't sketched out what like a project creation flow may look like that could be generated from a meeting artifact or other things, but just imagine some sort of index. I have also delineated between projects and areas inspired by I think I'VE mentioned this before to many of the folks on this call. Like the second Brain para method from Thiago Forte projects being short term with a distinct end date. So for example, building the minimum viable product of an app, whereas areas require continuous efforts over long periods like customer support is something that for a product company probably doesn't end. It's just a continuous effort. And we think that that will require a slightly different flow or slightly different.... Way of handling it in the app, but could nonetheless be in it.\n\nBrad: Moving on. This is not super interesting, but like a project overview page is probably for a particular project is probably going to look like a Gantt chart.\n\nBrad: It'll probably have dashboardy type modules within it, and those dashboardy type modules could show like a decision log. It could show upcoming time off from people who are working on the project. It could show recently completed tasks, etc. Nothing super groundbreaking here, but this is sort of where you would most likely land if you were of that sort of manager or leader profile or Persona. And we're trying to get a vibe check on how a project is going.\n\nBrad: But then we get into some of the more interesting stuff. So if you were to drill down from a project overview into different project subpages or tabs,\n\nBrad: You can imagine a details tab which is where the requirements are treated like a first class citizen. So we think that requirements should be versioned using git or git like mechanism. This isn't necessarily saying that they should be checked into the repo, but they could be. I spent most of my career in client services and needing to generate change logs or change orders all the time because clients change their mind or scope changed or things happened.\n\nBrad: We recognize that this happens at product companies as well, too. And we need a source of truth for what the actual requirements for an app are. Otherwise, our tickets have nothing to reference. We don't know if they're actually moving the needle.\n\nBrad: They're just sort of a stream of noise. So the idea of versioning requirements and keeping them as a source of truth for all of the work towards a particular feature is interesting. As part of this, there should be a decision log and a decision queue that shows where change is originated from.\n\nBrad: This is sort of a common thread that we like very loosely illustrated with this floating circle in the bottom right is there should be project manager agent of sorts that in this context may help you identify gaps and requirements, opportunities for scope reduction, dependencies, etc. But that's sort of an aside. Just assume that there's some LLM that has all of this context, plus potentially more corporate context from Grapevine or other tools that could answer questions too.... But the way that.\n\nBrad: Changes to requirements happen could be interesting. So in this case, there could be an action that happens in Slack, for example.\n\nBrad: Where Hyunji may say, hey, wouldn't it be cool if we did xyz? And then Luigi says, okay, let's do it.\n\nBrad: And then an agent chimes in and says, you know, should I add this to the requirements and create a task or tickets feature, whatever. It would be interesting to have that sort of decision flow baked into a platform where the result ends up as sort of. I think we even talked about this as like a Tinder style. Ui. You know, imagine like, there's a decision log that, a decision queue that you have to go through to decide whether the scope is in, the scope is out, and you're reviewing this as a team, and it's almost like a swipe right, swipe left. If things were. Were that easy, or you could drill down into further discussion something they require it. And if something were to be included, for example, then you're seeing a diff of when the requirement stock was materially updated with more scope or less scope or whatever.... Then there could be some.\n\nBrad: Constant validation loop where requirements are referenced against outstanding features and tasks to make sure that the outstanding features and tasks or the TO dos actually encompass all of the requirements.\n\nBrad: And this too is something that it feels like sorely missed from our current flows. Then maybe this is happening with webhooks whenever the requirements change, or whenever tickets change or to dos change. But then you're sort of keeping this constant reference loop that may flag like, hey, these requirements are missing. Or hey, these tickets actually don't service any of these requirements.\n\nBrad: Why are they being completed? And can we down down prioritize them, for example? But those are like, those are some ideas around what tracking requirements and a decision log as first class citizens could look like.\n\nBrad: Into what actual to dos or tickets should look like.\n\nBrad: We think that in order for them to be used, they need to feel extremely simple. Some people prefer paper to do lists like I typically have one, or I do have one almost every day. Some people do live out of linear, and some people live out of other tools as well. But linear can feel really burdensome because of all the data that it requires to actually create small granular to dos. And so people often just don't.\n\nBrad: But in the age of context awareness, AI auto classification and knowledge of requirements and the like, we should be able to just take plain text tasks or to dos and either assign them or group them into features, reference them against the requirements and create a list in that way. So if you have features in this context, naming TBD may act as parent collections of tasks, and tasks are atomic ish work units with statuses. But tasks may be created through several means. So maybe there's some natural language processing in chat. I think that's what some of the vowels are looking at now. Like maybe there's some just discussion in pertinent slack channels, and those are turned into tasks. I think that's what we're looking at doing right now. Or some of the stuff that we're looking to do right now is linear. But I think there could also be mirrors, so impertinent linear projects, if linear were being used.\n\nBrad: Tickets from Linear or Jira or GitHub issues would also show up as tasks in this queue in this project management app, but then they could also show up by way of actions.\n\nBrad: And this is sort of akin to an activity log. So I used an example with the design team the other day.\n\nBrad: Where this is like a month or two back where I think I had done something like 40 PRs in the month and three of them had linear tickets because I just didn't bother creating linear tickets with the rest. Like, it's just annoying and an extra step to do. But I still want record of that. Action because it was work that I did that day.\n\nBrad: And it should also be checked that it is in service of a broader goal which maybe enumerated in a requirement stock. So when that's happening, a new PR on GitHub should show up as a task in this app, and maybe it shows up with a status and review if it were just opened or Maybe it's complete if the PR was merged. The same thing is true in other contexts, where a designer may share a slack message with a link to a figma and that should show up as a task. And these again can be thought of as something like an activity log. This is where we could replace one of the chores of standup. What you're saying, you know, what you're working on, all this stuff, it should just be a sum of your task status.\n\nBrad: For that given day or a week or whatever the time frame may be. Additionally, something that I don't think we captured here, or maybe raised as a question is like should tasks be suggested to ICs based on inference? And that could be from inference of project requirements. It could be shown that like a feature is being burned down and there's only a handful of tasks left, and it sees that your queue is empty. And it could suggest in this queue, hey, why don't you tackle these things next? There could be some sort of intelligent or intelligence or prompt around doing that, which would be interesting. Again, coordinated by some sort of agentic PM that has all the context, knows what people are working on, says, hey, someone is, you know, Brad is falling behind. Can you help him with these tasks? Because this deadline is coming up. For example,\n\nBrad: And those could show up in one skew. But this needs to be so clean and so simple and so easy to do and useful that people will actually ideally use it. Because for some, maybe thinking of, like, people.\n\nBrad: Like business analysts or sort of data sciencey roles. They may not have integrations that show exactly what they're doing all the time, and they may not want to create linear tickets for it. But if we can manage a to do list for them that's super clean and easy, and that is constantly referencing overall requirements for a North Star, then maybe they'll be inspired to use something like that as well.\n\nBrad: And the last tab is just. The last tab, in this context at least, is just a team tab. And this is probably pretty simple, but it should show who is allocated to a given project or effort now, what their availability is like if they're going to get engaged in Spain next week, like Daniel.\n\nBrad: No, just kidding. You saw it, but I'm bugging him about it. And then maybe skills are relevant past work or knowledge, so other contexts that could be useful and that would feed into again some sort of agentic PM that helps take these requirements and map them into features and tasks and keep things moving along.\n\nBrad: There's a super long winded prd that describes this in more detail here. This is generated by OpenAI chatgpt. Whatever.\n\nBrad: I haven't. I just did this half. Well, chatgpt to this half an hour ago or 45 minutes ago or so. I haven't read through it.\n\nBrad: In complete detail. So I don't even know if it's all accurate, but I did prompt prompted and had to ask clarifying questions and such. And then there's sort of a condensed version of that same sort of thing over on the left.\n\nBrad: But. Yeah, I'll open the floor now for thoughts, discussion.... What aligns, what doesn't, etc.\n\nphillip: Yeah. So I think this is exactly what we all had in our minds in terms of what the smoothest, coolest version of new AI, New World AI Project management could be.\n\nphillip: I think the thing I'd be curious about the most is to start to get concrete enough that we get really excited about a thing that we could actually build and ship.\n\nphillip: And get feedback, and within the next.... Ideally, like three months, I guess.\n\nphillip: It's like if you had to choose a few of these features and it could be a standalone app, maybe for just a single team, maybe even just for a single project. Just to simplify it for the first version that people can try. I'm curious what we'd simplify it down to.\n\nBrad: Yeah. To me, it's a first class notion of requirements.... And first class notions of features and tasks.... And those being.\n\nBrad: It auto updated, for lack of a better term, but those being kept live.\n\nphillip: Has to be, like, super accurate, right? I think that's probably the biggest aha moment.... Is like, wow, I don't need to think about this anymore. This thing's got it covered for me.\n\nBrad: Yeah, I think it's like. I mean, it would look like and feel like working with some of the best PMS of your life who never took a vacation.\n\nphillip: Right? Or also just reading every single thing possible, including your GitHub PRs.... Pms never do.\n\nBrad: The all knowing wizard of oz. Pm.\n\nphillip: Yeah, and actually like a PM that you don't have to talk to that much either. Even the best PMS you ever worked with, you still kind of need to tell them.... Like this is what I did. This is why I haven't done yet.\n\nBrad: I think that is, yeah.\n\nphillip: Sorry. No, that was my full thought.\n\nBrad: Yeah. That is one of the marks of, like, the best PMS I've worked with is they aren't bugging you for things because they know they've absorbed the context through the available means. And I don't have to be like, okay, where are we at on this?\n\nphillip: One.\n\nphillip: Piece of input I had on the requirements and decisions.\n\nphillip: There should probably also be, like, an input.... Because oftentimes people or customers provide input that you've already considered.\n\nphillip: So it's not actually like, a pending decision. It's actually just, like, pending input, I guess.\n\nphillip: It would be actually kind of cool to organize that in a place where it's like, this is just input. We know you've seen this before, or we know its input on not the highest priority part of this project, but it's just like in this other place for you to just scroll as well.\n\nBrad: Do you think those would be rejected decisions?\n\nphillip: Well, they may be deferred decisions. Like maybe their decisions were. The team collectively doesn't feel the need to make a decision about it now.\n\nphillip: And maybe you don't like. There's two ways you can think about that. You either think about that as we made the decision not to consider it now.\n\nphillip: Or you could just consider it as like this is just pending input.\n\nphillip: One last thing I loved was I like the idea of a Tinder style UI for making decisions, actually, because.... Oftentimes, a live project can.\n\nphillip: It's so hard to stay focused because random things come up at all sorts of times and you're making decisions at all sorts of times versus it'd be cool if it was just like a one place where you just made all the decisions and all the context for each decisions right there for you.\n\nBrad: Yeah, I think that.\n\nBrad: I would love to see that this is where potentially integrating with something like, I don't know if any other video platform. So like if there were first class support for something like this and gather and you could have real time transcriptions feeding into this sort of thing, then you were able to circle back at the end. To like, okay?... What decisions do we need to make? Let's go through these action items as a group.\n\nphillip: Yeah, that's cool.\n\nBrad: It'd be really neat.\n\nphillip: Yeah, and then you also mark down the reasoning for each decision, in fact.\n\nphillip: This could potentially be one of the most important things for training a company specific decision maker in the future, because you actually have a single log of all the decisions that were made, plus the reasoning as a group as to why you made some decision or not.\n\nphillip: And then maybe the AIs would learn and start to make all the easy decisions for you.\n\nphillip: Or if you always come back to one principle for making decisions, learns to do that. That's really cool.\n\nBrad: Yeah, I captured a few notes there, but feel free to annotate or edit.\n\nevangeline: Yeah, I think I really liked.\n\nevangeline: A bit about autonomously capturing changes across your entire stack. I think, again, that's something that we were pre aligned on and that was also what was in my brain.\n\nevangeline: I was already, like, the decision log, like the queue stuff.\n\nevangeline: Because I think one thing that has always been quite difficult tracked across a suite of tools is changes are happening across multiple conversations, sometimes even in ones that I'm not part of.\n\nevangeline: And it's pretty cool to be able to see in one place, okay, all the changes that are happening across the project. So everyone's on the same page.\n\nevangeline: One thing that I had. I kind of thought when I was looking at this proposal,\n\nevangeline: I think we need to be careful about how, well, I guess what utility this tool is bringing.\n\nevangeline: I'm not sure what the customers exactly. I'm not sure customers want. It's perfect.\n\nevangeline: Log of every single thing that's happened within their project or perfectly organized background. I think the ultimate paid point we need to help them solve is this project being steered in a way that increases velocity or improves delivery or what is the ultimate.\n\nevangeline: Like, how would their project be different now that they're using this tool? I think some things around automating, standups and so on, that's important. But if this tool is able to steer projects because it's now able to surface information that was not easily discoverable before, it's able to connect the dots between things, or it's able to be like, this is a dependency and you're putting a project at risk because you're prioritizing the wrong things.... I think that could be pretty leveraged.\n\nevangeline: Yeah, that's my vague, immediate feedback. I guess basically what I'm trying to say is we need to be careful and we might want to be careful not to much on perfect capture, because profile capture is not, probably not what people are asking for. I think what they're asking for is a way to improve delivery.... And capture, like may or may not exactly solve that problem, if that makes sense.\n\nphillip: I think the way that I would reframe that is.... I think the capture needs to be really accurate.\n\nphillip: But it doesn't need to be exhaustive. In fact, it's probably best done if it's, like, prioritized towards what kind of information actually people actually need.\n\nphillip: But yeah, I think it's still worth then drawing the connection between that and why is it actually.... Helping people.... I think making the project ship faster.... Is one value prop. I think the second one is actually just enjoyment of the day.\n\nphillip: Like the day can be a lot more focused. There doesn't need to be as much glue work to get people on the same page and motivated and bought in that an idea is important.\n\nphillip: Less time each individual needs to spend translating all the stuff they talked about into their own to do list less timing.... To connect with other people, making sure everyone knows what's going on.\n\nphillip: And I think that value prop is more like the cursor value prop. Whereas, like, autocomplete didn't actually speed up people in terms of number of hours spent coding, maybe, or it didn't actually speed up the speed of tickets, but it made it a lot more fun. And I think that's still actually a big part of what we're going for is just, like, make work itself just far more fun.\n\nevangeline: Unless you agree that because I was like main value prop.\n\nevangeline: Okay. I think the form factor of autocomplete felt good, but the main value prop was something along the lines of, like, you're a better engineer because now you're.\n\nevangeline: Either, like doing things faster or closer, is able to pull in patterns.... That are more aligned with the code base.... You're able to solve problems, like, more correctly.\n\nphillip: Well.\n\nevangeline: Autocomplete is more of a form factor thing, isn't it?\n\nphillip: I think if you were to ask, like, why did it blow up?... And specifically, why did they get so much word of mouth?... I think it's because people loved using it.\n\nphillip: And I don't think anyone was telling their friends. I'm actually getting X number more tickets done per day.\n\nphillip: I think they're just saying I can't live without it. And they didn't want more specific than that. And my read is people. It was just more delightful experience.... By a lot, actually.\n\nphillip: It's pretty good not to have to type all that random stuff that you used to have to do in the past.\n\nBrad: Yeah, I do think an aspect of it is less friction overall, so you just get stuck less if you're programming with AI. Like, you may have had to go on a rabbit like down rabbit holes previously through Stack Overflow, through asking peers, through digging through GitHub issues or whatever. So it is sort of in a way like removing those barriers that help you focus on the enjoyable aspects or the creative aspects of creative act of building things, which has some overlap with potentially some of the value props that we could offer in an app like this is there is less of all that other stuff and there's more just pure creation, ideally. With like this.\n\nBrad: Amazing product agent who's looking over your shoulder and ensuring that you have sort of gentle guidance, working towards common goals, reference by requirements, who's calling out gaps or related work that may be being worked on by peers.\n\nBrad: Identify. Okay, this. This feature idea was great, and I just reviewed the PR that Evan merged or something. But we should also look at doing XYZ as a result. So let me put some more tickets.\n\nBrad: In service of these new capabilities that are now enabled because of this work. That evangelist checked in.\n\nBrad: Yeah, I think there's some interesting correlations there.\n\nevangeline: You can get.... Life is a pure.... I'm not sure what. I'm escapating this well enough.\n\nphillip: Well. Any good? I think it's kind of hard to dissect exactly why Cursor won, but I think what I'm trying to say is I think we shouldn't underestimate how much value there is in just making someone's day more pleasant, even if it doesn't translate. Into a larger velocity of work getting done.\n\nphillip: Yeah.\n\nBrad: Not having to reiterate your work in standup would make everyone stay more pleasant. I think so. There's a small win there.\n\nphillip: It's going to be really hard for us to quantify energy levels, but if we could, I think we can make a dramatic improvement on that. And I think that's my case. My take for a lot of tools that were successful is that's what they mostly did.\n\nevangeline: Okay, let me go and think about this a little bit. I think one thing, one reflection I had.\n\nevangeline: Trying out a ton of different products lately is like, okay, and this is like a totally tangential example. Not going to relate a project, but one thing I notice about Snowflake, for example.... You can't even freaking invite a user on Snowflake.... And Snowflake is this, like, multibillion dollar business, right?\n\nevangeline: And I'm just like, wow, there is something so valuable about this product that even if there are some parts of it where the friction is so high, people still want to use it.\n\nevangeline: I guess, principally, I'm trying to think.... Like.\n\nBrad: You muted. There you go.\n\nevangeline: Oh, I'm not sure why I got muted randomly.... Sorry. Where did I get.\n\nphillip: I think I understand your point. Your point is, like, if we could go after a snowflake thing, we should.... Which I agree with, actually.\n\nevangeline: Yeah. I think my field was something that is like, oh, this thing is the best tool ever because it's so smooth to use.\n\nevangeline: It almost feel like a counter example of what successful products are typically like, if that makes sense.\n\nphillip: Well, I don't think it's a counterexample. I think it's just a different win condition.\n\nphillip: I think there's different kinds of product. Like Zoom was another example of it's video chat that just works.\n\nphillip: Everyone technically had a video chat, but the quality is what made the big difference. Slack was also an example of There are plenty of chats out there, but Slack was the highest quality one. So I think there's different tools out there that either win based off of details and quality and smoothness, but there are definitely the ones like Salesforce and Snowflake.... That win purely off of.... A business job, it gets done.... And actually explicitly not on the user experience.\n\nevangeline: Now to help.\n\nphillip: And I think I agree with you. If we could find a business use case that is so compelling, people would use us even if we weren't high quality.\n\nphillip: The thing we should go after. Because if you marry it with quality is even better.\n\nphillip: That's how we can think. That pushes us. I think big enough.\n\nevangeline: Yeah, I think maybe my overall take is like, if we are going from a pure quality, light, quality of life, ease of use of angle, we are almost playing on hard mode.... Like.\n\nphillip: It also just doesn't seem like it's utilizing AI strongly enough.... That's the only angle we have here.\n\nphillip: I think we can come up with something here that feels, like, super new and you can't live without once you do it.\n\nBrad: I didn't think that this was playing on purely like a quality angle at all, really. I thought it was the main value prop being you have a simplified aggregate of work being done and referencing that against versioned requirements that are kept up to date based on company context, conversations, etc.\n\nBrad: I don't think we'll design the best can't chart or whatever. Like we could maybe, or do other stuff, but I don't. I don't think that is a value prop at all. I think it's all of these other connective tissues.\n\nevangeline: Yeah, sorry, my comment here wasn't really to the overall proposal. I totally agree with you Brett. I think my response was more to the possible value props. Less blue, more enjoyment point.\n\nevangeline: Because that feels leaning more towards light. Okay. Quality of life.\n\nevangeline: As a value prop instead of, like, a deeply painful problem that we're solving really well.\n\nphillip: Although I think we still need to connect the last dot, which is I think this is a big enough idea where it's like task tracking has changed completely, but I think we need to connect it lastly, to who really loves this? Why does either the business really love this or why do the users really love this?\n\nphillip: What is, like, the one or two things that were, like, we need to get this right or not?\n\nBrad: Yeah.\n\nphillip: Maybe we can brainstorm a little bit.... And write stuff down somewhere here.\n\nBrad: Yeah. One thought there was us, many of us coming off of, like, hack week projects. We're working on very small teams or sometimes working solo. Like, is this something that an individual would use?... And what would it need to look like for, like, an individual to use it?... And.\n\nBrad: I think I could see myself using something like this coming off of, like, a hack week project.\n\nBrad: Because it still feels like there's room for some sort of higher level organization of like making a product into a complete sentence, like making sure that you're thinking about things exhaustively. And there's sort of some, some of your work and a to do list even to keep track of, of what's upcoming and what can potentially be delegated to agents or claud code or whatever.\n\nBrad: Yeah, I think that that's maybe an interesting thought experiment, too. Is like, what. What would. What would something need to look like for even just an individual to use it, and what could be a compelling story for them?\n\nevangeline: I was actually thinking about this, and I was.\n\nevangeline: Like, I worry that for single individual, the pain point is just not large enough. Because if you're working on a solo project, the odds of you being able to keep all the contacts around this project within your head is pretty high.\n\nevangeline: Unless we are saying that our belief is individuals are able to do projects of this magnitude of 10, 20 people in the future very soon.\n\nevangeline: I think the main pain point we're trying to address here is context is spread across multiple tools, conversations, people and organizing work.\n\nevangeline: Complex projects is extremely difficult. Like, keeping things up to date is extremely difficult. But if you're building for a single person,\n\nevangeline: Why wouldn't this person just be able to keep everything in their head? I guess is my question.\n\nBrad: I think I ideally like you have almost a personal assistant style product expert who is.\n\nBrad: Sort of looking over your shoulder in a way and calling out gaps in the requirements that you're authoring or other feature considerations or suggesting like next steps with tickets, which, like Claude does that to some extent. Codex does that to some extent, but not really conclusively. I think maybe the prompt was more so. It should be whatever it is should be so easy to use and so non verdant. Sum like the opposite, ideally so joyful that individuals would feel inclined to use it despite not requiring maybe the feature set that keeps context up to date between multiple people working on the same team.\n\nphillip: Yeah. Okay, wait. So maybe Sorry I didn't have access to right into your dude.... So maybe we try to brainstorm what are the killer core value props.... So the first one that you just mentioned was.\n\nphillip: It's the enjoyment.\n\nphillip: It's the enjoyment of the individual on the team to no longer have to.... Update anyone else.... Or update a tool on what's going on.\n\nBrad: If done correctly. I think that this absolves that need.\n\nevangeline: I do think there's like two angles here. I think for the IC they should feel like they are just doing the work rather than managing the manner of work for other people. So hold enjoyment never having to update anyone. I think there is another value prop which you need to serve, you need give like the PMS or project managers or ems or whoever, like the people who are, like, overseeing this project, which is like, this project needs to be delivered better, faster or whatever because of this tool.\n\nevangeline: Mav light. The way it does it is through connecting the dots in a way that a human would struggle to do.\n\nphillip: Oh, I see. Actually, I would consider.\n\nevangeline: Oh, I was able to identify dependencies for you.\n\nphillip: Yeah. I feel like this seems like a different.\n\nevangeline: Yeah, like two separate points.\n\nphillip: Yeah, so.\n\nevangeline: So for.\n\nphillip: Project is delivered faster because of this tool, because it proactively surfaces insights like Insights blockers.\n\nevangeline: Insights block us dependencies.... It's able to help you steer the project, basically.\n\nphillip: Yeah, because I still. I still think there's.... A point here on enjoyment from the ic, from the manager.... Because it's easier.... To get updates as well.... Because inevitably, if you ask other people for updates,\n\nphillip: Like. It also takes some time to understand what they're saying. And everyone has their own format.... So he won't put a lot of effort into them and all that kind of stuff.\n\nphillip: Another value prop potentially is if all the todos and all the context of the todos is accurately represented. It's easier for agents to help you with that work.\n\nphillip: And I think.... The best case scenario for this is.\n\nphillip: As many of the chores as possible, like writing messages or updating docs you never need to do yourself.\n\nevangeline: I mean, it could even be things like.... This is where you delegate a code change to an agent as well, right?\n\nphillip: Yeah.\n\nphillip: Besides the accurate updates of work. One thing I liked about this proposal was this is another enjoyment piece.\n\nphillip: But because of the organization, organization of information and work.\n\nphillip: I think maybe there's better enjoyment from decision makers as well.\n\nphillip: Because, like we mentioned, the decisions could be grouped.... All the relevant context in a Tinder like ui.\n\nphillip: Or input could be triaged.\n\nphillip: According to priorities.\n\nphillip: And then from the ics.\n\nphillip: Maybe.\n\nBrad: I think just if like if decisions are treated as a first class entity decision login queue and maybe one way reviewing them is through a Tinder like ui, I think that that is just so much less cognitive load for having to think about all the different places where we talked about this in Slack. But then this person was in the meeting where we discussed it, and they didn't have the context from Slack. They didn't see the message. And then two other people met synchronously and discussed some other thing. But if we're rolling all of that together, then like I Ideally, you have all the context. That's happened. You can see, like when the requirements change, when scope was added or when scope was removed, and you're no longer needing to maintain all that context in your head because some tool is doing it for you.\n\nphillip: Actually, this is actually not just an enjoyment point, because if we actually make companies help companies make better decisions,... That's very tangible.... Business value.\n\nphillip: Even just the perceived notion of making better decisions, I think people would definitely be like, wow.... Can't live without that thing.\n\nevangeline: I totally agree.\n\nevangeline: I think the way I think about this is a great project manager isn't just a notetaker.\n\nevangeline: If it's purely just like capturing all the context, helping people to do, stand up, this and so on, then it's almost like, well, why not just have a perfect note taker? But I think the best project managers are able to make better decisions.\n\nphillip: Easier.\n\nphillip: Or others on the team to be bought into the decisions.\n\nphillip: Do we actually think there's a compelling value prop here for an IC's personal to do list?\n\nphillip: Like I felt this this morning where I was.\n\nphillip: Okay. I'm going to spend some time organizing my own work. It'd be kind of interesting if the AI had already.... I kind of wanted to be an NPC this morning, I guess, is what I'm saying.... And just have the work just given to me.... But we think there's a compelling enough value prop there around. Could we organize people's to do lists?... Better and make that either more enjoyable or more productive.\n\nJohnnyD: I kind of think so. I mean, similarly, I feel like the first thing on my to do list today was ketchup on Van and Brent's changes and make sure I understand the current state and run the eval once, just, like, catch myself up.... And I would have loved to not have to do that.\n\nBrad: Yeah, I think if an agent or system had sufficient context in the overarching theme of something that you were trying to do, even as an individual contributor, it could proactively go and tackle things on your list or even predict what might be next on your list and be like, hey, I have a first draft of this feature already. It's in the subtree, like do you want to see the diff? Or something like that? Or I thought that you may need xyz. Like I've gone ahead and done that already or written up a spec for it and it's just ready for you to review. But I think there's a proactivity angle of it where when it's working perfectly, it's sort of reading your mind in a way, and planning next steps for you.\n\nphillip: Look at that. Be pretty crazy, I guess. It's kind of like this one, whereas.... Can even proactively do stuff.... And suggest actions for you.\n\nBrad: As soon as you update your own personal to do list.... An agent grabs that ticket out of your queue.... And they're like, okay, like, I'm working on it.... You know. I see you're working on this other thing.\n\nphillip: Pretty crazy.\n\nBrad: Like. I'll get this one.\n\nphillip: That's really cool.\n\nphillip: Okay, so I think this one is definitely. Actually, wait, I want to finish the thread on like, do we see opportunities to make personal to do list better?\n\nphillip: Because I'm personally a little split.... I haven't completed the thought for myself, but I could believe that.... I take here.\n\nevangeline: I'm not sure whether to do list is the ultimate form factor, but I do think there.\n\nevangeline: Like as a human, I need to understand what is my cue of things to do.... Because it's like.\n\nevangeline: Like, if I'm on a really complex project, I kind of still need to organize the information in my brain around life.... What am I doing right?\n\nevangeline: I guess. How else would people even do things?\n\nevangeline: You could say, like, oh, we do a PR and then it just gets automatically synced, but how do I know what order PR should be done? And so on. I still think there's some kind of queue that we need to show people.... I'm not sure whether the form factors are to do list exactly. I mean, maybe it is. I don't know.\n\nphillip: It's kind of interesting because to do lists.\n\nphillip: Are the only the way that we organize information today.... Because.... The work is bespoken.\n\nphillip: That if you were to be super granular, it would be changing too much.\n\nphillip: What I mean by that is you get a task and then you try to split up the PR some way, but then you discover something, so you split them up another way. That kind of stuff happens in knowledge work all the time.\n\nphillip: But.... And so in a world where you have to manually update it, it's just not worth it to, like, have a to do list at that granularity.\n\nphillip: But maybe in this world, you actually do. Like the human is the npc.\n\nphillip: At times it's like, okay, now go find this thing in Notion. I couldn't find the thing in Notion. Okay, you couldn't find it? Okay, let's try to. Let's just do it then.\n\nJohnnyD: I feel like the other value that to do is provide for me is helping group similar pieces of work that I hadn't grouped in my head already, like just getting them all down and organizing it. If I have to do some engineering work, some design work, some thinking work, I'd rather do all the engineering work. That's related at the same time. So it's like I have less context switching, and so it's not quite prioritization, but it's like, how do I want to structure my whole day?\n\nJohnnyD: I feel like the main to do list use case that excites me here is around enrichment have. I still kind of want to get my brain state written down, even if it's.\n\nJohnnyD: Low fidelity to dos. But then I want it to be enriched with. Oh, actually, to your point, Brad, somebody else is already working on this part in this subtree or. Oh, actually, here's the detail for that doesn't actually have to be a task. Here's the answer.\n\nphillip: Oh, I see what you're saying.\n\nphillip: So, like you as a human, in the morning, you write down all your questions and thoughts, and then the AI turns that into what you should actually do.... Or some of them, it just, like, gives you the information.\n\nJohnnyD: Yeah, I tend to start my day by writing five to six bullet points that can be aren't legible to anybody else, but they make sense to me as just reminders of the things that I thought about this morning as I want to go out and accomplish today.... But something might just be research tasks that can be crossed off immediately.\n\nphillip: Interesting.\n\nJohnnyD: Some of them might be. Oh, by the way, this is actually something you shouldn't do because the van's already halfway through working on it.... Just let her do it.\n\nBrad: Yeah, two more points on the to do list angle. So one is that I did consider. I don't think I captured anywhere here but the notion of private to dos. So things that you don't want surfaced necessarily to others in this project context, but you can still use those, or an agent can still use those. With your permission, whatever, to go out and gain other enrichment, as you describe Johnny, to help plan your day, to reduce context switching or something, per your example. But perhaps there is like the notion of private to dos that our notes just for yourself or your scribbles and then to dos that do that are surfaced and all these other areas of what you're working on to PMs, you can see those to DOS that you made and elsewhere, and then also thinking of to dos as.\n\nBrad: Not like, directly synonymous with an activity log, but in a way, like an activity log is the same sort of thing. And that was the example I used before, where, you know, last ones I maybe submitted 30 PRs or 40 PRs or whatever, but I only had three linear tickets.\n\nBrad: Because it's just annoying to have to create more. Whereas I would prefer those show up as completed tasks, completed to dos, whatever, in this same sort of data structure, so that it's then ingested by whoever needs to see what I did that day, or stand up, or is tracked against common goals with requirements and the like.\n\nBrad: Yeah, but that's true too that personal to do isn't always scoped to single project.\n\nphillip: Okay. I think there's a pretty decent list. My take immediately is that this one probably should be at the bottom of our list because this one seems like the hardest by quite a large margin.\n\nphillip: I think we should exhaust us trying out these other ideas before we consider this to be the reason why we're good.\n\nphillip: But actually, all these other ones seem, like, not too difficult.\n\nphillip: Very legitimate reasons why this could just be, like, a huge.... Must have for a company or for people at the company.\n\nphillip: And I think it'd be cool to center on prototypes that really show off some of these value props.... And maybe this is where we can actually start taking these ideas to customers.... Something.... We could take the prototype and just be.... Show it to people, see if they're interested in the general idea.... Before we actually start seeing if we can build it.... What do you guys think?\n\nphillip: Oh, sorry. And one last thing. As people were talking, I forgot when this came up, but one primitive we might want in our thing as well as priorities.\n\nphillip: Like, I don't know if you're too late. Your task list is actually the best representation of your goals.\n\nphillip: And each our system having an idea of what each person's goal probably help a lot with.... Understanding what's relevant to that person or what they really care about.\n\nphillip: Or when you interact with someone else, you can easily understand their priorities.... How they align or don't align with your own.\n\nBrad: Is that beyond the context of a project? You mean like priorities overall or specific scoped to a project?\n\nphillip: I guess it can be attached to a project, but there could even be individual ones, I guess.\n\nJohnnyD: I was interested in think about.... Because.\n\nJohnnyD: I think this kind of fits into the delivered faster.\n\nJohnnyD: In my mind, though, because at least the project version of it, because.\n\nJohnnyD: Basically helping with the case of I have a thing on my plate that's maybe low priority and it's someone else's high priority. So the task gets shuffled around to somebody who can take it on more easily. Or is there a different kind of value, you think?\n\nphillip: I think this is not attached to a value prop anymore. I think I'm just talking about, like, a potential idea.\n\nphillip: As a primitive in this. If we're talking about projects.... Tasks and features. I think priorities might be another.... Potential one.\n\nphillip: Sorry. I bring this up not as, like, a value problem bringing up just as, like, another thing that we might need to add.\n\nphillip: Cool. So, yeah, I guess the next thing is like. Yeah. What do you guys think are the next steps?... Brad and Daniel for what you guys want to explore next? What do you guys want to do next?\n\ndaniel: So, like, going back to.\n\ndaniel: Risks Brad up in the beginning of this meeting where.\n\ndaniel: The question of do we want to use linear as.\n\ndaniel: The main platform to surface a test versus making our own. And then I believe we aligned on making our own. Right. But I guess.\n\ndaniel: We still haven't really worked through what could.\n\ndaniel: UI could be right. I guess my mind is still quite stuck on the linear esque list and.\n\ndaniel: Also feel free to add more comments. Right? But yeah, basically I'm unsure if we're still.... Going to build those foundational.... Ui stuff.... Where all this information lists.\n\ndaniel: Or should we just spend the next couple of days exploring what that future risk ideal UI could be? Which, unlike I would thought what should.\n\ndaniel: I guess. Like, my question is, like, do we have clearer sense on what these could be like?\n\nphillip: Yeah. So I think.\n\nphillip: Might take is we should do design work with the eye towards having something that is showable.\n\nphillip: To other people, customers and get their feedback on it.\n\nphillip: And I think we can simplify as a result, simplify some of our thinking. So, for example, I do not think we need to consider projects and areas right now.... And I think we maybe don't even need to consider team stuff right now.\n\nphillip: I think the parts that we want to ideate around are features, tasks, requirements and decisions, and we could send her them around these value props that we just came up with, like maybe different ideas that.\n\nphillip: Double down on maybe the four parts. I think the last one is the heart. I think this one's pretty hard to deliver.\n\nphillip: We sooner deliver one of these ones and then add this thing on. So maybe there's somewhere between one to four prototypes that really show off each of these value props.... And maybe that's would be my take of what we could go after.... I understand if you guys think that's right.\n\nBrad: Yeah, I think so. I think.\n\nBrad: Maybe more on the same page subconsciously than we all may have thought.\n\nphillip: Yeah.\n\nBrad: Potentially because there wasn't a ton to go off of, other than this general notion that managing projects should not require as much busy work as it does currently. So with early feedback indicating that this is directionally approximately where we think we could uncover some value, then we can kind of reference our sketches here against this core. List of value props that you've enumerated, Philip, and start to see what we may be able to carve out through the framing of demo driven development, which is something that we can certainly do.\n\nphillip: Yeah. Also an extra credit is if any of them are good enough to just post on Twitter. I think we should just do it. I think that's what we should get into. That's what we should feel more like, is some product studio that people are interested to see the idea, even if we don't. Have something to launch. They're interested to see the ideas and give comments on them, even just getting some attention, just getting some thoughts.... So yeah.\n\nphillip: Amazing.\n\nBrad: That's good to me. I don't think I've made my annual tweet. I do about one tweet a year, so save it for this.\n\nphillip: You'll have like, four tweets to make in the last half quarter of this year.\n\nBrad: Oh, God.... Yeah, thanks.\n\nevangeline: One other thing I'm doing with 30% of my time is identifying some potential design partners or icps that we can work with. So these are also other people that we can show demos to and get more primary feedback from data from.\n\nphillip: Sweet. All right.... Or.\n\nphillip: Cool.\n\nphillip: Should the engineer stick around next to talk about the ground truth?... Saying.... Yeah. Daniel just shared it in our Slog Channel.\n\nphillip: This is the kind of short I get rid of at Daniel share the Figma file, and then we have to share links back and forth all the time.... Why?... I'm sold. This will get product market fit.... Even if it's not Snowflake or Salesforce.... No more links.\n\nevangeline: Sounds good.\n\nBrad: Yeah. On your comment in chat. Evan, do we want to schedule, like, a work session tomorrow? Kind of open ended for all of us or whoever's available to talk through this in more detail.\n\nevangeline: Yeah, sounds good.\n\nBrad: If we had agentic PM with real time transcriptions, they could just set that up for us now.\n\nphillip: Cool. Okay. Should we get into talking about the ground truth, then?\n\nphillip: Josh. Maybe we just keep the same one.\n\nevangeline: Okay. Yeah, let's talk about the eval stuff. So I think there's, like, three open questions I wanted to address, which is, like, one. Do we feel like the input is correct?... I think Josh has some thoughts there.... We think the ground truth is correct.\n\nevangeline: And then three. Do we just ignore the scoring stuff? Because I think the sorting stuff is a little bit off right now.... Okay?\n\nphillip: Oh yeah, I think we just ignore the scoring stuff. I'm just scoring it manually every time anyway, and I don't think it would save much time to fix the LLM scoring.\n\nevangeline: Okay, great.\n\nevangeline: That case, let's talk about the inputs first. I think Georgia had some thoughts here, right?\n\nphillip: Yeah.\n\nphillip: Yeah, I think we might have. I think we might as well. In fact, that's one way you could paralyze is like, maybe we each just find a different meeting to use.\n\nphillip: And then we'll solve it in whatever ways we need to and hopefully, actually, our solutions just generalize.\n\nphillip: Yeah.\n\nphillip: The other take is that we just created an eval that has multiple data points. I think the trouble with that is the kind of work we need to do here is like, the person who's debugging a data point in the eval basically needs to memorize the meeting.... In order to have all the context to actually debug it properly.\n\nphillip: So I think it can make sense that we just continue focusing on one meeting at a time.... And then.\n\nphillip: And then we just go from there. I think there's going to be a lot of things while we're going to solve in the future to coalesce our updates.\n\nphillip: We probably eventually want to create an eval that we can run to even check regressions.\n\nphillip: To make sure that we're doing well across all meetings, but I think it makes sense that. Josh, maybe you could just find a payments meeting, sit on there, record it.\n\nphillip: And then maybe one of me or Johnny go pick up a project current meeting.\n\nphillip: What do you guys think?\n\nphillip: We just add in, like, two or three more meetings to just work off of.... What do you think, Johnny?\n\nJohnnyD: I think my main question right now is if this is a new eval. I think there's a lot of value in this, but I still feel like we haven't quite cracked lke1, and I still actually feel like it's pretty close. I know we ended up talking about it on trip New data structure stuff both on Friday and indesign today. But I think our core focus of just getting the tasks out minimum was kind of did well enough that I feel like we still can actually crack that. And I wonder if we're basically deciding lke2 right here.\n\nphillip: Yeah, I think we are. Or. Sorry, I think.\n\nphillip: It doesn't really matter to me if the dismantling distinction between if this is LKE2 versus if it's still K1. Is there something more specific that.... Wondering about here.\n\nJohnnyD: I think just.... Or doing them Friday.\n\nphillip: Team about team focus or something.\n\nJohnnyD: Yeah, I think just focus of do we think. I generally think it's a good idea. We should have more data points and we should have different types of things.\n\nJohnnyD: But I really just want to make sure that we have some confidence on being able to pick out tasks from a meeting. And I wonder if it's going to actually a harder task if we now do lots of different types of meeting.\n\nphillip: So. Okay, I think maybe me and you just finish up the existing meeting.... Because I think we probably can get.... We can either decide we can solve it or not by the end of today.\n\nJohnnyD: Yeah.\n\nphillip: I think it still makes sense that Josh and Brent could each take one more meeting on their own. And maybe they're easier meetings. Maybe we already solved them.\n\nJohnnyD: Yeah, maybe.\n\nJohnnyD: Right way to think about. Maybe the way you think about this is if we have high confidence that we can solve lke 1, and if we just hope, okay, 1, 2, trying to get the tasks out, which we believe we can do because minimum gets there, then we should already be thinking about the next.\n\nJohnnyD: Evals. And the question then becomes is more types of meanings the thing that we need to test or we should be.\n\nphillip: Oh, I actually, I think Josh is. I think Josh's point is, like, even if we can't solve lke1,... Maybe the problem is that this meeting is the hardest kind of meeting.\n\nJohnnyD: Yeah.\n\nphillip: And so we should see how we can do on an easier meeting.\n\nphillip: I think that's. Yeah. Because, like, maybe we don't want to get too hung up and make too many conclusions about a really weird type of meeting.\n\nphillip: So I think it's good. In any case, if we solve LK1, then cool. We validated on a second meeting. We can't solve LKU1 then cool. We're seeing if we could do an easier meeting.\n\nJohnnyD: Okay, cool. That makes sense.\n\nJohnnyD: And, yeah, I think, Philip, I basically just need to figure out today whether or not we think it's solvable.\n\nphillip: Yeah.... Okay?... So let's get to the second point.\n\nphillip: And maybe a van. You can first give me and Johnny the context of the conversations you guys had over the weekend. Because you wrote seems like we're disagreeing on the whole of granularity and comprehensiveness. For the last me and Johnny I've heard we actually all agreed.\n\nevangeline: Yeah, sorry we had to offset without you all. That's fine. Okay, so I think there's, like, a few points.\n\nevangeline: One from my perspective is like, do we have to be this comprehensive? So do we have to also capture action items or tasks that are like non committal? One thing we notice from lke1 is we are also capturing tasks that people kind of just float it but never really committed to.\n\nevangeline: And we think right now we should capture them. But I'm wondering whether this is of any value to people who might want to use this product. The second thing is, and this is Brent's point, I wish it was here, but it's whether the current categorization of things is, like, meaningful, correct. And maybe it doesn't matter for the purpose of the eval, but tasks and subtasks. I think he had. I think we kind of talked about this in standard as well, like whether it was the line was very blurry between, like, a task and a subtask. And then also certain phrases like are we identifying some things as.\n\nevangeline: Like. Sorry, are we miscategorizing certain things as tasks? But they should be risks or dependencies, like Daniel's pto.\n\nJohnnyD: Yeah.\n\nJohnnyD: My take on this is we most likely have the wrong objection right now to Brent's point. Right. I think the main goal I had in the discussion conversation Friday was just acknowledging that linear tasks isn't necessarily the right one. But I think actually this is coming a lot out of the work that Brad and Daniel are doing here?\n\nJohnnyD: Of if, for example, these are the kind of direction we're interested in and the pros we're interested in.... Features, tasks, decisions.\n\nJohnnyD: These are kind of the objections that we now have that we hadn't talked about before today. And then as it relates to the eval, I think it's probably not super important as much as getting just a basic thing. Why I'm like, right now we only need to focus eval on tasks, all the subtasks potential tasks explicitly are out of scope. Similarly, all the decisions explicitly out of scope. All we have to do is extract these 10 things that we all agreed are the concrete action items. And we also agree that there is a data structure that we are working towards that captures this and is not tied to linear.\n\nJohnnyD: So I think that answer is Brent's question. And I know he's not here, but correct me if I'm wrong. Does that kind of clarify that one?\n\nJohnnyD: And Philip also here. So if you disagree on anything I said there.\n\nevangeline: I think it's fine. We are deprioritizing the other like the non tasks.... I guess I'm curious.... For this ground truth. JSON.... Something like.\n\nevangeline: Sorry. Okay. Something like this? Is this to a task? Is this do something we're expecting to be generated. Oh, no.\n\nphillip: Yeah.\n\nphillip: So my perspective is the problem right now is purely we're trying to solve the technical problem.\n\nphillip: And so all that matters is we come up with a very specific criteria.... That all of us can agree on.\n\nphillip: It's not. I think the categorization is not the product spec.\n\nevangeline: Yeah, that's fine, but we should at least be very specific on what is 1000. What is it? Right. My take is we shouldn't be generating this as a task.\n\nphillip: Yeah, but what is your proposed criteria?\n\nphillip: Instead. Because the criteria I think we've come up with is actually pretty clear. It's like an action that someone has committed to do, like now.\n\nevangeline: I think my take is whatever we roll as the initial dog. Remember when we first wrote the ground truth in White Notion? I think that is the correct list of tasks. It's whatever humans remember as the concrete next steps for this project.\n\nphillip: Yeah, but the problem is that's not actually good enough, as usually not specific enough as a criteria for us to.... Not have to spend time debating, right?\n\nphillip: Because what happened was, when we used that as the criteria, things would be generated from the agent, and then Johnny would be like, wait, so should we add this to the ground, Truth or not? And I think we just need to eliminate that back and forth right now.\n\nphillip: So that we can just take a new meeting, Josh can run with it, and we can know that he's going to label the ground truth the same way the rest of us would.\n\nJohnnyD: I think a specific example of that is just coming back to it. Then the agenda doc that you created, there were kind of three categories of work design, find customers and figure out the eval. And in the ground truth that we wrote afterwards, there was nothing about ICP or customers. But then, since then, you've done work on trying to find ICP and customers and think about that. So say clearly our memory was biased to the end of the meeting where we spent a lot of time talking about the technical details of eval. And when that came up from the agent, we all looked at it and said, oh yeah, wait, we did say we would do this, and then it has been done. So I feel like.\n\nJohnnyD: I agree that just what we remember is probably the wrong bar.\n\nevangeline: Yeah, I'm probably not being specific now. I guess intuitively recording Daniel's pedial just, like, categorically doesn't feel like a task to me.... But.\n\nevangeline: Okay for what's up. I'm also not sure whether I'm just over anchoring on this specific thing. It feels like to me, over the weekend, I was trying to update the prompt. I was almost optimizing for something that didn't really make sense.\n\nevangeline: And maybe that's why I'm kind of reacting in this way right now.\n\nevangeline: But I'm finding it hard to kind of articulate what the right way of doing it is.... Too.\n\nJohnnyD: I think I do feel you in some ways of. I think the only one on this list that we have is low. I think we all kind of agree, like, this isn't necessarily something we've ever put in linear or would be kind of at the same level as other things, and maybe it's something around the human management side of like, this isn't a work task as much as it is like a people manager task. And this is the only one of those. And maybe that's the changing criteria in the bar is okay. Scheduling should not be included.... And that is sufficient for today.... I'm curious if that strikes a chord with you, Van.\n\nJohnnyD: So I think if we can align around the definition, we can update the ground truth to match to fill the 20 much to about like how do we stop doing the back and forth?\n\nphillip: Yeah.\n\nphillip: I prefer the simplicity of what we have today. And also I can see a world in which our products spec changes so that.\n\nphillip: Things around pto. We actually just let the agent do.... So, like, I don't really mind that we include it.\n\nevangeline: Okay?\n\nevangeline: Yeah, maybe it just doesn't matter for what's up. I'm also trying to observe and understand how this thing works. So I might just be anchoring on things that doesn't really matter right now. So I'm down to just keep it in.... All. I really explicitly fill it out. Scheduling tasks. Maybe it doesn't matter.\n\nphillip: Yeah, I'd love to. Just get, like, five meetings, and we feel like we did it.\n\nphillip: Super accurately, and then we can get to the next thing, which is.... Now, how do we want to actually turn this into a product?\n\nphillip: And then design the algorithm for the product rather than just solve a very specific but very related problem.... Technically first.\n\nevangeline: Okay, sounds good.\n\nphillip: Like. Okay, just one last thing. I basically view our current work on engineering.... To be explicitly solving technical risk.... And Brad and Daniel's work to be more on product spec.\n\nphillip: And so we want to talk to customers. I'd actually rather do them with, like, Brad and Daniel's work rather than around.... The general idea or something like that.\n\nBrad: I wonder if there's also some eval play where we take the data structures I proposed, for example, with like, features, tasks, requirements, and decisions, and we try to see if it's these structures or another structure that become like the easiest to parse or have like the highest rating in eval. And then we that as a constraint and how we design the product. So, like, this is an assumption that maybe these. These group or data structures make sense, but maybe don't, or maybe there's something else that performs better.\n\nphillip: Yeah. This is actually one thing I was really curious about, because we all rely on the base model incredibly heavily.\n\nphillip: So there could very easily be biases in terms of what it's good at, parsing from meeting transcripts.\n\nphillip: And so there's a chance we may need to actually.\n\nphillip: Do our criteria based on what elements are good at rather than what is the ideal product experience as well.\n\nphillip: So I think all that to be said, I think it just still makes sense. Let's just go with a single simple.... Criteria for now.... So let's solve it first, and then let's try to do other.... Other criteria.\n\nphillip: I'll even think to myself, like earlier this morning, maybe we might need to fine tune again. Who knows? That would suck if we do.... I really hope not.\n\nJohnnyD: We got a ways first.\n\nevangeline: Okay, sounds good. Let's just stick to this ground to prove that.\n\nphillip: Cool. All right, so our actions are. Me and Johnny will continue trying to solve lke1.\n\nphillip: Josh and Brent will try to take out another meeting and maybe advantage. If you have time, you can take one more meeting.\n\nphillip: Or maybe the three of you take two meetings. Who knows what happens? You guys can figure that out.\n\nevangeline: I'm going to try Softalk E1, actually.\n\nphillip: Okay. All right, then we can all try solid LK1.\n\nevangeline: Okay, I'm going to go talk to Jenan real quick, and then I'll come cowork you guys.... All right.\n\nphillip: See, guys?\n\n",

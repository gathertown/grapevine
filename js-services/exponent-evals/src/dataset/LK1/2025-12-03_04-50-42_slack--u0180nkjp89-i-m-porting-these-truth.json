        "description": "Problem\nCustomers are confused by the Linear connection + triage onboarding flow. Jasmine (Heron Data) encountered unclear states and friction when trying to set up/use triage.\n\nObserved evidence\n• Evangeline flagged customer confusion in proj-exponent and investigated the Linear connection + triage onboarding flow\n• Customer thread shows confusion around how triage works, ability to edit Linear target, and multi-project constraints\n• Team proposed adding a proactive setting to control triage posting behavior and clarifying connect/disconnect states\n\nWhy this matters\nConfusion during setup blocks adoption and creates support load. Clearer UX and state transitions should increase successful installs and reduce handholding.\n\nProposed scope (first pass)\n\n1. Clarify Linear OAuth connect/disconnect states (explicit status, confirm/undo, and post-disconnect state)\n2. In triage settings, expose a proactive mode toggle:\n   • Off: triage silently proposes in thread; user must approve\n   • On: triage auto-posts suggested changes with clear undo\n3. Channel → Linear team/project mapping UI and clearer copy for multi-project orgs; guidance in-Slack for selecting target per-thread when needed\n4. Improve error messaging when token scope is insufficient, with re-auth CTA\n5. Add in-product breadcrumbs from Slack thread messages back to the relevant settings pages\n\nAcceptance criteria\n• A user can clearly tell whether Linear is connected or disconnected, and what to do next\n• In a mapped channel, triage behavior is predictable based on the proactive setting\n• Users in multi-project orgs understand how to pick/change the Linear destination\n• Insufficient-scope errors present a re-auth path and do not appear as silent failures\n\nNotes / links for context (Slack threads)\n• proj-exponent: “we might need to improve the flow here a lil, jasmine from herondata got pretty confused”\n• Customer channel: Questions about editing Linear ticket in thread; need for better control over triage behavior\n\nOwner\nTBD",

Is there a way to force update grapevine's hubspot sync?\n[2025-11-19T16:22:00.000Z] Kumail Jaffer: @Chandler can you and connectors squad look into this?\n[2025-11-19T16:23:00.000Z] Kumail Jaffer: @barrett the expectation is that hubspot sync is never more than a couple of hours out of date (at worst). this is likely a bug on our side.\n[2025-11-19T18:42:00.000Z] Chandler: yep we'll take a look!",

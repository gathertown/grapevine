Jordan confirmed tenant-pruning code will be in staging within the hour and reported that monthly cloud spend has fallen from roughly $60 k to about $25 k, with OpenSearch now the largest remaining expense. Chandler agreed to scrub noisy alert spam as an on-call task this week to restore signal quality. The Grapevine Reviewer and Verification/Intent loops remain top priorities; teams will keep iterating and aim for minimal viable versions by week’s end. Exponent’s ambient extraction is live again in staging, prompting follow-ups on Linear ticket labeling and Cursor credit usage, while Johnny will meet an OpenAI rep today to discuss credits amid shifting usage patterns. Unresolved items include further cost optimization opportunities and ensuring adequate ticket quality for downstream automation.\n\nNotes:\n\nCost & Tenant Maintenance:\n  - Tenant-pruning cron tested via CLI; Jordan will ship to staging and merge today, with logging and multi-day dry-run.\n  - Cloud spend cut from ~$60 k to ~$25 k after buffer and embedding fixes; OpenSearch still ~$6 k/month.\n  - Jordan to rerun full-day cost numbers tomorrow for accurate baseline.\n  - Long-term levers: batch embedding API, potential OpenSearch replacement.\n\nAlert Noise / Reliability:\n  - Alerts Slack channel flooded with non-actionable messages.\n  - Vic proposes treating clean-up as regular on-call hygiene.\n  - Chandler will tackle it this week (estimated 1–2 h).\n\nGrapevine Reviewer Workstream:\n  - Dave refining per-category reviewer; currently flags too many valid issues.\n  - Andy working on dedupe/denoise; Vic on false-positive reduction.\n  - Team will sync again this afternoon; objective remains useful signal with fewer distracting comments.\n\nVerification & Intent Loops:\n  - Goal: ‘any-percent’ working loop by Friday, prior to NY off-site.\n  - Codex agent CLI struggled; browser workflow better but Playwright retries inefficient.\n  - 8 k-character limit in Cursor prompts noted; formatting quirks acceptable for now.\n\nExponent Ambient Extraction:\n  - Feature re-enabled in staging; harvesting stand-ups, Slack messages, and PRs into Linear boards.\n  - Some Linear tickets originate from TriageBot; need labeling to distinguish sources and curb Cursor credit spend.\n  - Kumail confirms no prompt changes yet; purely ported functionality.\n\nOpenAI Usage & Relationship:\n  - Project ‘current’ responsible for ~⅓ of November OpenAI token spend; investigation ongoing.\n  - Johnny meeting new OpenAI rep later today to explore credits and best-practice guidance.\n  - Team expects to have sufficient usage to justify credits despite recent cost cuts.\n\nUpcoming NY Off-site:\n  - Most attendees confirmed; Andy and Jordan cannot attend.\n  - Dave may miss due to potential jury duty (murder trial).\n\nAction Items:\n  - description='Merge tenant-pruning cron job to staging with logging and dry-run, then deploy' due_date=None assignee='Jordan'\n  - description='Rerun and share updated cost numbers after a full day of real usage' due_date=None assignee='Jordan'\n  - description='Scrub noisy alerts in Slack to restore actionable signal' due_date=None assignee='Chandler'\n  - description='Meet with OpenAI representative to discuss credits and usage optimization' due_date=None assignee='JohnnyD'\n  - description='Send Johnny an example Linear issue generated by ambient extraction' due_date=None assignee='Kumail'\n  - description='(maybe?)

Got to see seven national parks, so that was kind of sick.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Seven and seven days or something.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Man, that sounds busy.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah, it was busy. It was busy.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Some of them we saw, like, two in a day because they're, like smaller parks.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): I see. Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: But we hit up a bunch of the Utah parks.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: Yeah, I can't have that. I just saw my wife's family, which was very nice, no complaints.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): We went to one national park. We spent a few days in Yosemite. That was good.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Never been there so late in the season, though. It was, like, kind of icy.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Get some good fall foliage, at least.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Pretty colors.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Yeah, it was good.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): There's just one trail that I really like that's kind of long that I've only done in the summer when it's really crowded and hot and stuff. So super different vibe to do it with a bunch of ice on the trail. Everyone has crampons and stuff.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Or not Everyone. Some people brought crampons. We didn't, but it was kind of fun still. But yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Slides.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Okay?\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Let's get into it. The two things I wanted to check on first were just the two things with Jordan from last week. Wait, Jordan's here? Right. Yeah. Okay.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Like the cost stuff and then core tenant cleanup. I think Jordan posted a bunch of stuff on cost in the channel, but just wanted to see if there was any more high level to give.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): And then otherwise, it sounds like there's some kind of tenant cron. Tenant pruning thing, like work of progress. But it's not merged yet. It's not live in staging, just Jordan. Where are we at on that?\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Yeah. I think\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I need to just\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: do\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: a little testing so I I can have it in staging in, like, thirty minutes.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: tested it out through CLI, and it works fine. I just wanted to double check the path with\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: with\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Ron and see how we can log that and have a dry run for a couple of days we see what comes out of it. But So that's\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I'll I'll get it merged in\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: before end of the day for me.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: And cost, not too much\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: more than what I posted.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: The numbers didn't make sense.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: For last\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: month. I think we were, like, at\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: 20 k\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: twenty twenty three k for\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: turbo buffer.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: But we should be more around\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: 5 to 600 a month.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: That's like that would be our normal\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: we we pay for rights.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: To\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: $2 for per gigabyte.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: And that's dramatically gone down.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: For OpenAI, it was the same thing. We were embedding for every single chunk\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: So that should also\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: reduce the embedding cost by a lot. If you look at\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: the run rates\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: for, like, today and yester yesterday is not really representative of today.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: You can see the big the stark difference already.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: So, yeah, in terms of cost, I I I would need to, like, rerun numbers\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: with a whole\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: a whole day of true usage.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: So I can have it, like, maybe tomorrow,\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: when I see the numbers for today.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: The biggest cost that's left, I think, is\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: the\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: open search. I think that's still where we can gain a lot.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: It's at 6 k right now.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool. I don't think we need to do much more on cost. I think it's good that we looked into it, and it's nice to see such a stark improvement. I think other things we can optimize later on down the line if we want to, but the way I see it is, like, the main reason we want to do this is just to get a handle on, to try to get closer to a reasonable level and also just get a handle on where the cost is coming from, which I think we kind of have now.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): There's also some, like, there's also some long term things that we've always said we could or should do if we got to a point where cost actually mattered more. Stuff like the batch embedding, API, stuff like potentially like moving off of Open Search entirely, that kind of thing. So we have a lot of options.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: What what is the final number that we're spending monthly?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Across\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Across everything,\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Like I said, I I\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I only had last month\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: which was, like, 60. If I added everything up.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: But\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I think it's closer to\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: 20 something.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: 25.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Based on 6 about 16 or\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: for AWS.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: And then,\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: OpenAI would probably be around\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: 10.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Yeah. Something like that. Yes.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Got it. Got it. Got it. Okay. So so it was it was, like, 60 k before your changes, and now it's 25 k. Okay. Yeah. Makes sense.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Next thing I had was this thing we wanted to check in on again from last week, which was just some core liability stuff.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Really the main thing was that our alerts channel is kind of back to being.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Flooded with nonsense. It's like mostly. It's mostly just noise at this point.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Which it's not great hygiene.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Thanks for pointing that out, Dave. So I think maybe this is such something that on call can take a look at possibly this week. I don't know what your plate looks like to speak, Chandler, but I think this might be like a quick one hour, two hour thing that's worth investing in periodically. And I think generally over time.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): We should probably just treat this as an on call thing, so I think that's like the appropriate distribution. Anyways, what do you guys think?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Makes sense to me. I can grab it.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool. Moving on. Grapevine Reviewer I think we're roughly in the same place as last week. We still have the same rough priorities that we talked about on Wednesday that me, Andy and Dave talked about on Wednesday. So that is specifically like days working on this per category reviewer split thing where we take a slightly different approach. High level approach to how we actually do the review.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Andy's working on some Dedupe Denoise stuff, and I'm working on kind of a similar vein of reducing false positives.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): I think it seems like we're still kind of. We have worked on this a bit to some degree, and we still have some more things to do. I think my suggestion for the three of us is just to keep going on whatever we were doing and then checking again with the three of us this afternoon. But I'M curious if there's anything else you guys want to add. Andy and Dave?\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: I'm running into a little bit of a problem with the category reviewer, where it's calling out correct stuff, but there's too much of it.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: I'm like, oh, that is true. We should do that differently. But I don't think it's a practical number of comments. I just told.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: Well, we can catch up on this later. Sorry. It's not important. For the whole group.\n  - 0a1ce2ec-17df-47dd-a349-85eacb0aa44c|Andy: I mean, Impact will probably upload that.\n  - 0a1ce2ec-17df-47dd-a349-85eacb0aa44c|Andy: Once we merge our work together.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: Yeah.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: That makes sense.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Yeah. This kind of makes sense for category viewer, though. This makes sense as a thing that would happen, I guess.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: Yeah.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: It didn't make sense as a way to reduce comments.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: It never should have been a thing I thought would happen.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): I actually never really saw it as a way to reduce comments, though. I kind of saw it as a way to make sure or to hopefully.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Make the true signal or the best signals stick out more above the noise to make sure that we actually found useful things to say.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): For everything because I don't think we were consistently finding useful things to say.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): For everything before.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Yeah.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: Yeah.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool. How's verification, Loop? Anything you guys want to talk about or share or update on?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I don't think we have a ton to update on.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Were both out last week. Jordan and I have to\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: don't know if there's anything major you\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: worked on verification loop.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: No. The only thing I reported is I tried to use\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Codex agent CLI\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: and there were it was\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: it was having a harder time than the\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: IDE.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: IDE\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: browser use is pretty\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: awesome.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: awesome.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I can figure out problems a lot.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Easier. The\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: the agent doesn't have that\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: built in, so I had to try and use something else. And I tried to use Playwright, but\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: what it was doing is\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: writing the playwright estimating it,\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: trying it, and then trying it again. So it wasn't as efficient.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: So, no, I couldn't get it working yet.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: That that that's my only update. And then I switched over to other things.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Well, yeah, I think\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: goal that we've had talked about\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: some of the Friday before break was\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: some version of the intent loop going. I think we're still kind of trying to get there.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I think we're very much just trying to get any percent speed run complete.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: So even if it's\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: a comment on a PR that says go do this thing in cursor,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And that's how you do the like, run the verification loop.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: That might be kind of\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: what we strip first.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And then we'll figure out how to make it kind a better process.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I think the other\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: side of this is\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: we've been talking more and more about\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: needing higher quality tickets.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And a lot of our work is impacted by how\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: kind of\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: is the input at the top of the or at the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: front of the funnel. So\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: male exponent and being extraction\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I feel like we might end up\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: converging more and more on some of the the work there.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I was gonna try to find you later today and feel like I might end up working closer to the exponent stuff.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: So I I think not in time to share right now, but\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: expect some stuff to change in the next\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: by tomorrow.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Oh,\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I wanted to quickly add. I\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: did ship the\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: comment on a PR. So if we review, it adds to the comment, and you\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: on it, and it will open up in cursor.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: There is some formatting issue there, but cursor just, like,\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: it can handle it, and that's on their side. They\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: decoded wrong. So you see a lot of plus in your\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: prompts. And they have, like, a 8,000 character limit\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: So your test plan need to fit into 8,008 characters. But\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: that's that's there.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Nice.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Sounds like we all still have roughly the same goals for the end of this week that we had originally set out, like the week before Thanksgiving, which is basically roughly just like get something working on both fronts by the end of the week, which also kind of just makes sense or is nice time wise because next week some of us are going to be in New York for this little mini offsite thing anyways. And so that would be sort of a nice thing to have going into that week of co working together and that sort of thing.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): That this still makes sense to everyone. We still feeling okay about it?\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Who? Elvis is going again. So I think, well, Kumal and Johnny will be there. I'm going, Brent's going, Chandler's going, Dave is going, and Andy can't make it. Is that right?\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Alright.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): And Jordan can't make it, I assume. Yeah.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Okay, cool. Sounds good.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: I'll throw out. I have dirty duty Thursday, and chances are low, but it's possible that that turns into, like, a murder trial and I can't make it to New York next week.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Yeah, got it. True. True.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool. Okay. Lost through this week, and then we will see most of each other next week.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Excited for that.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: One one click.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Update on the exponent side.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Ambient extraction\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: is live in staging again.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: So, hopefully, we see some bugs automatically get squashed now.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: coming up for that, what\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: is being immediately extracted? Like, is this meeting gonna be extracted?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: This yeah. So the stand ups for Grapevine Connect\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: is Grapevine QA and Exponent.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Are getting ambiently extracted.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Then Slack messages in AI grapevine internal, AI grapevine connect\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: and project exponent.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And we're also listening to PRs\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: in corporate context.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: To mark things as done.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Cool. And now I'm actually being created linear in AIVP?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yes.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Or each team is, like, routing to its\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: its board.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Okay. Cool. Yeah. Makes sense.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Could you just send send me one when it when it is immediately extracted so I have an\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: example look at?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yeah. Actually, if you look in linear right now, there's a bunch of stuff getting extracted from Slack already.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Are they the triage issues that are piling up made by a van?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Yes. I think so.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Some of these are coming from\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: TriageBot, which is already working.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: But then these ones with shorter descriptions, think, are immune extraction.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: We had a label to distinguish. I think right now we're using a ton of our cursor\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: cloud.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Credits.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Running on every triage bot one.

Glad to see it's there.\n  - 6af5a016-363f-490e-bdb8-a2c833d02de5|Brent: Have you guys made any changes to exponent other than just, like, getting it up and running on, presumably, the Grapevine weekend?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: No. So so far, it's basically just been ported.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: And then otherwise, it should work\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: more or less exactly the same as before.\n  - 6af5a016-363f-490e-bdb8-a2c833d02de5|Brent: Like same prompt as well.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: Same prompt, same everything.

Current\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: is\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: one third of our\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: OpenAI cost for November.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: They they do ambient extraction or something.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Current, the project.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Anyone know?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: It's alright. Ask that again.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I said current was, like, 6 I mean, was a third of the OpenAI costs, but that's like an internal project. What do they do exactly? They\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: they just make ambient extraction\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: and then\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: show a dashboard\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): I can just run a bunch of stuff on every. On more or less every message that comes in. So I think it just ends up piling up. That's my guess.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: And you're using Alex's\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: API key, so he's like the\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: he's using more than all, but combined.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: That's actually that's really interesting.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: It threw me for a loop for a second. I'm like, why is\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Alex using so many tokens?\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: It's using more than, like, all of our prod tenants combined.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Yeah.\n  - cd1e047b-b8ba-40c4-bcec-0abd2d1a45e1|Kumail: That's interesting.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Yeah.

Andy and Dave will begin productionizing the review pipeline today, splitting work front-to-back, while Andy also sets up a Slack channel to log all internal system outputs before GitHub posting is enabled. Johnny is weighing two paths—building a slower GitHub-based controller loop versus a faster local-container loop—and will decide after consulting Brent and Jordan later today. Chandler continues to drive alert-channel clean-up, targeting near-zero noise by week’s end. No major blockers surfaced, but dev-env flakiness remains under observation.\n\nNotes:\n\nProductionization & Logging:\n  - Andy and Dave confirmed they will work on productionizing the system today, with Andy handling the trigger/front end of the loop and Dave handling the posting/reaction end.\n  - Need an overview of every PR review; first step is to dump all internal outputs into a dedicated Slack channel before wiring GitHub posting.\n  - Parallelizable tasks can be handed off to others later in the day.\n\nController Loop Options for VibeWork Demo:\n  - Johnny outlined two approaches: (1) GitHub PR-based loop (slow, high latency) or (2) local container with tools for Claude (faster, but larger upfront work).\n  - Quality and iteration speed are key concerns; decision pending input from Brent and Jordan this afternoon.\n  - Regardless of path, a controller loop is required to handle failed verifications and re-tries.\n\nDev-Env & Quality Monitoring:\n  - Some flakiness observed with dev environments; root cause not yet known.\n  - Stand-up doc will track any repeat issues.\n  - Chandler working toward zero noise in alerts channel by end of week.\n\nAction Items:\n  - description='Set up Slack channel to capture all internal PR review outputs' due_date=None assignee='Andy'\n  - description='Productionize review pipeline (front to back)' due_date=None assignee='Andy & David Orr'\n  - description='Reduce alerts-channel noise to near zero' due_date=None assignee='Chandler'\n  - description='(maybe?)

The comment got posted and someone's upvoting, downloading it, or maybe even replying to it.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: Off.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: Yeah, I think that makes sense.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Okay, cool.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Also, Andy, if there ends up being a lot of parallelizable stuff, feel free to cut tasks or whatever and dump them over to us as well. We can just check in later in the afternoon today, but I'm going to look at some other quality stuff a little bit more to a 2 but I'm also just down to jump over to help productionize whenever as well.\n  - 0a1ce2ec-17df-47dd-a349-85eacb0aa44c|Andy: Good. Sounds good.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Anything else to talk about on your side, Johnny?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I posted a Gottem's one pager.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: In here.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: It's pretty short, worth a read.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Essentially describing the the VibeWork demo\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: we're trying to work backwards from.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And he has a product called Starfolk that he's\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: creating to to achieve that.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: One thing that's becoming really apparent, and I think\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: both Jordan and Brent are out this morning, so I gotta catch up with them this afternoon.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: But we need some\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: controller loop\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: to make the VibeWork demo work.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I'm kinda debating right now\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: where my time is best spent. And if you guys have thoughts, I'm I'm open to it.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Between\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: improving ambient extraction ticket quality more\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: and actually just building some controller loop.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Where\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: hit the coding agent, and then we run the validation plan and feed it back to the coding agent.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Kinda repeat until we get to good evidence.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Some of the con consideration is\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: it's not really clear to me what we want a good ticket to look like.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Until we actually have a loop to test against.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Like, it's kind of just our own intuition of what would you give to a coding agent.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Been trying to run an\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: eval around this, but I don't feel like it's very productive.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: But at the same time,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: the controller loop that's the most obvious\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: us right now is basically use the GitHub PR.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And have agents talk back and forth through that.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I worry it's gonna be very, very slow.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Like, latency is gonna become a real problem.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Because if every time the agent wants to test code,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: it has to push commit and then wait for the dev env to update,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: that's flaky. We're gonna\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: quickly see, like, multi hour iteration loops for\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: simple PR.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Assuming there's, like, a problem with\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: So\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: my, like,\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Wait, how do you update the dev end if not push a commit to it?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Well, the other version of the control loop\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: here could be\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: we actually just make these all tools for\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Claude and run it with a local dev setup in a container.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: So we create a container that has basically tilt\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: and\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: or sandbox that has tilt,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: and cloud. And we give cloud a generate test plan tool, browser tools,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: and\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: whatever ticket is coming in. And it just\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: iterates into it, has evidence that it's ready for.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Which is more similar to what Gautam's talking about here.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: We could also just build it in parallel.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: So I'm kinda debating\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Should I just go build that? Should we get to the intermediate\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: like,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: PR as the as the\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: context window solution, knowing that it's gonna be kind of\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: too slow to be feasible.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Or\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: do I just focus on task extraction?\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Wait, so intermediate PR as context window. Like the main issue you're trying to solve with that is just this latency thing, right?\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): That's the pull take of.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): The controller loop.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: The controller loop is a controller loop is needed.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: To basically\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: make this helpful in case the verification fails.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Like, right now, the coding agent will do a try,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Verification fails.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: That's it.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): But it sounds like you're saying it would probably work via by using the GitHub PR. It would just be really cocky.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: There's a version we can do with GetUpGr where the evident if the verification\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: acceptance has failed, we basically just\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: ping cursor with the test results and say try again.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And we keep using the cursor\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: kind of\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: agent loop\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: and just\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: do that. The problem is every time cursor makes a try,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: it's gonna have to wait five, ten minutes.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: For dev env to update.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Right.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And then run the acceptance tests.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And there's, like, just a lot of hackiness to making that all work.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: It's not clear that it's actually gonna be very smart.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Maybe a single agent that just\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: has tools and thinks about all this or maybe sub agents.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Works better here.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I'm worried that that's kind of, like, a bigger\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Yeah.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: piece of work to to bite off and start working on if we still haven't actually gotten a full loop going.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Yeah, I see what you mean.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): My take is like, I'm not worried about the end result. If we get to the end result in the demo is good and whatever. And the only issue we have with the demos, maybe it's not real time because we have this hacky situation going and there's some latency. I feel like you can just cut around that. You can cut the video. It's not a big deal. Like, hey, whatever, right? It took an hour, but it still got done in the background.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): And it was really high quality. And look at all this test plan and look at the evidence. But the main concern I have and maybe the main reason I could see for just deciding to bite this off right now would be if you think it's going to dislike multi hour loop is going to significantly slow you guys. Down from making progress.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yeah. I think\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): If that's the case, then maybe just pay upfront and it's worth it.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: think that's one of the considerations. The other one is I\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: intuitively, I feel like the quality will be lower with this approach.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Okay?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Like, because it's actually just agents talking back and forth.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I wanna I wanna dig into this with\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Wait, is that actually true? Like, theoretically, if you talk back and forth and you jump everything that you actually need to dump, it's, like, fine, right?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: This\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): But maybe it's just, like, hard to practically dump all of the useful stuff that you actually needed to dump.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I think my my thought here is, like,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: when you use a coding agent locally,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: how often does it run Lintz? And how often does it run Lintz for, like, very basic stuff?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Now each one of those is an agent handoff.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And so\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: it makes a tiny change. It's failing, like,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: a a good verification.

I was gonna say.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: At least it'll be uninterrupted.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Are you still.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Where where are you now?

We we\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: started to get snow already.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Like, a week or two ago.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Just have some more this weekend.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I feel like it wasn't\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: snowing against us, like,\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: late January, February.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: That's a good point.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, dang.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: It's weird.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: I was just blaming the fact that I was just in trying to. In India, and it was a lot warmer and it was like shorts, like 80 degrees in Delhi.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: I came back, it's like 30.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Dang.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Bit of both. You're, especially\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: sensitive to it, and it's a quarter than usual.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: Yeah.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: Makes me feel a little better.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Infuriating.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: That jury thing.

If I have to go in.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): The substance test is kind of cool. Wait, so this just runs in with browser use in a dev end?\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: Yep.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Nice.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: There's a couple of caveats to it of you have to add\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: three different labels.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: You have to do them in a particular order.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: With some kind of delay in between them.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Right.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: And\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: actually, it should put this in the stand up\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: doc, but I have noticed some\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: flakiness with dev ends.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: I don't know what the root cause is yet.\n  - 0c11b3fc-f738-42a1-9a67-46c32a080559|JohnnyD: But we have a success that we can point to now, which is cool.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Okay?\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Andy, Dave, did you guys ever get a chance to talk to. Okay, I'm guessing not.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Andy. I guess it just sent over where he left off last night. Theoretically, you two are both working on basically the actual productionization today, right?\n  - 0a1ce2ec-17df-47dd-a349-85eacb0aa44c|Andy: Yep.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: Yeah.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Cool.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): I realized one other thing that we're going to need eventually.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): In addition to just like the raw feedback mechanisms is probably. I mean, maybe this is served by whatever system we use to log results to ourselves internally. But we're going to want to be able to see some kind of overview somewhere of every review of every PR that we do, right? Or at least a link to every PR that we process or something like that.\n  - 77d6111f-11e6-4b89-835a-b948e4ed0f55|David Orr: Do you mean? Like, on the admin site, we have the Slack Feedback page where you can look at all the Slack responses.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Yeah, we're going to want to be able to look at all of the actual system outputs and not just what got actually posted, because we may need to, like. We may want to look at things that didn't get posted to.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): Yeah. It could be as simple as just making a Slack channel and then just. We just dump all of our internal stuff into there. That's what we've been doing in the past for everything. Probably still works fine.\n  - c93c652f-61b8-463e-9a39-02785815cc88|vic (human): But that probably just makes sense as a first intermediate goal because it's something we're going to launch anyways. So, like Andy, like something to think about. The first thing we want is we don't want to turn it off for everything immediately. Let's just run everything dump into the slack channel and.

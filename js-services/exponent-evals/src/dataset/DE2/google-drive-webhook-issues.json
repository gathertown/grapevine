Chandler aims to ship the new health-check system and a first draft of the Connectors v2 design doc to staging today, and will investigate a customer-reported Google Drive webhook problem. Jonathas updated webhook logic, migrated code to the new folder structure, and targets a Snowflake collector prototype by end-of-day. The group also brainstormed a modular registration approach and feature-flag strategy for future connectors.\n\nNotes:\n\nCurrent Engineering Work:\n  - Chandler: health-check system refactor; target deploy to staging today\n  - Google Drive webhook incident under investigation (possible overlap with Gmail mechanism)\n  - Jonathas: new webhook auth enum, Notion webhook updates, folder restructure complete\n  - Snowflake collector design & prototyping underway; leveraging AI for tool overview\n\nAction Items:\n  - description='Investigate Google Drive webhook issue reported by Kumel and report findings' due_date=None assignee='Chandler'\n\nTranscript:\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Kumel flagged an issue with Google Drive.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So there was some webhook issue that a customer was facing there. So I'm going to investigate that today and see what's going on.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Is it related also kind of to the Gmail one?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I don't know if it's for Gmail, they only recommend.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: They only said they were having problem this customers having problems with Google Drive.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So I don't think they have Gmail configured, but I can double check that. But it could potentially be something that's also impacting Gmail, even though Gmail has like a slightly different webhook setup than Google Drive.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Yeah. One is by comparison. Right. By token. Comparison. The other one is.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Yeah, I forgot the name of the other one.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: The other one is using, like, cloud pub sub or whatever.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Yeah, that's the one that I think Rick changed.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Anyways, I'll report back on what's going on there. Just in our. In our channel.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Because we've had some weird issues with Google Drive webhooks for quite a while.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So I'd like to.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Solve this once and for all.",

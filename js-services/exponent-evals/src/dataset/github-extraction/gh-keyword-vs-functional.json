Added proper chunk splitting and retry logic.\n\nChanges:\n- Fixed chunk size calculation in uploadService.ts\n- Added proper error propagation for failed chunks\n- Increased timeout for large file uploads\n\nActivity:\n\n2025-01-22 09:00:00 karenying opened pull request\n2025-01-22 10:30:00 devuser approved\n2025-01-22 11:00:00 karenying merged pull request",

These are currently stored in SSM, encrypted with a shared KMS key, **with each field as their own parameter**\n>   * Company Docs (Slack messages, notion docs, etc.). These are stored in RDS (1 db per tenant), Opensearch (1 index per tenant) and Turbopuffer (1 namespace per tenant)\n> * We store the tenant-scoped credentials needed to access each of these in SSM - **each as their own parameter**\n> * Last week, we had an incident where we hit the hard limit on SSM Parameters per account (10k Standard). We've temporarily mitigated by upping to using Advanced Parameters (100k limit), but these are more expensive and are still limited in scale\n>\n> \n> Our plan:\n>\n> * As part of our longer-term solution, we'd like to move to 1 SSM parameter / tenant. This would contain only the Grapevine-managed credentials (PG, OS)\n> * The External API Keys would move to being stored in RDS, alongside the Company Docs. They would remain encrypted at rest and well-secured\n>\n> \n> Question for you: Do you think there's any issue with us storing these external API keys in RDS? The only argument I can think of against it would be that if our RDS leaked we'd expose these API keys, but they can only be used to fetch the data that's already being stored in that DB so this feels like a weak argument\n> cc [@Kumail Jaffer](https://gather-town.slack.com/team/U0180NKJP89) if you have any other context to add\n>\n> **Achilleas**  [Oct 14th at 2:48 PM](https://gather-town.slack.com/archives/C01CNT77ZLG/p1760467689343929?thread_ts=1760467075.264589&cid=C01CNT77ZLG)\n>\n> Do we plan to store the external api keys in an encrypted format (for example, encrypted using a Grapevine-owned KMS. fwiw we ended up doing the same in Gather Core as well - [ref](https://gather-town.slack.com/archives/C02EGRGH8SY/p1755799946894989)), or will they be stored as plain text?\n>\n> **Josh Yavor**  [Oct 14th at 3:01 PM](https://gather-town.slack.com/archives/C01CNT77ZLG/p1760468487612829?thread_ts=1760467075.264589&cid=C01CNT77ZLG)\n>\n> ^this is the right direction - it can be okay to store safely encrypted versions of the keys in a database with the key management / encryption / decryption provided via AWS (KMS). that gives you the appropriate flexibility for separation of duties for keys while keeping the volume of keys manageable.\n>\n> > but they can only be used to fetch the data that's already being stored in that DB\n>\n> While this **may** be true now, this is not a safe assumption to make long term. Depending on what other future API integrations you add support for, any changes made to API authorization behavior for the existing integrations, or any configuration drift that may be introduced by customer decisions (over-scoping access accidentally), you can not rely on your integration's access being limited to \"read only\". You need to protect these credentials based on the assumption that some of them may (intentionally or not) have additional capabilities such as writing data and/or making state changes to your customer's systems.\n> Here's an example of a recent vendor breach where attackers went after them specifically for their API credentials to then get to their customer's data directly. Even in read-only modes, you don't want to be responsible for letting these credentials fall into attacker's hands.\n> Overview: [https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/data-theft-salesforce-instances-via-salesloft-drift](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/data-theft-salesforce-instances-via-salesloft-drift)\n> Coverage of impacted customers: [https://www.driftbreach.com/](https://www.driftbreach.com/)\n>\n> would the DB in RDS storing the keys be postgress?\n>\n> **Johnny D**  [Oct 14th at 3:14 PM](https://gather-town.slack.com/archives/C01CNT77ZLG/p1760469286713759?thread_ts=1760467075.264589&cid=C01CNT77ZLG)\n>\n> Yes, DB would be Postgres\n>\n> Makes sense. So sounds like this approach would work if we encrypt them with KMS in our application logic coming in/out of RDS\n\n**From Original Notion Plan:**\n\n> Kumail:\n>\n> \\> we need to find an alternate secret store\n>\n> @Johnny Dallas any suggestions?\n>\n> Johnny:\n>\n> thinking/looking through some options today, will have more specific ideas later toda\n>\n> Spent some time digging into this. Have a clear plan of action:\n>\n> \\- migrate to 1 SSM parameter/tenant, storing ONLY: OS creds, DB creds\n>\n> \\- all other secrets move to a new table in the tenant DB: external_secrets\n>\n> \\- all values are encrypted by KMS going in/out of this table\n>\n> Next steps would be to create this table, update codepaths for fetching/saving these values, and write a migration script\n\n**From Reinforcing Notion Plan:**\n\n> * plan:\n>   * keep using ssm, but 1 param / tenant\n>   * move all external creds out of ssm, into tenant db - it should only be storing pg and os creds\n>   * encrypt external creds via kms before writing to tenant db\n\nSynthesized:\n\nProblem:\n\n* Every tenant uses multiple SSM parameters \n* SSM has a hard cap on the number of parameters that can be used per AWS account\n* We ran out of SSM parameters, preventing new users from signing up\n\nSolution:\n\n* Migrate to only 1 SSM parameter per tenant by moving all non-postgres credentials into postgres, and consolidating all postgres credentials into 1 parameter",

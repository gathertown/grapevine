They agreed to build new Fireflies and Attio connectors next, hand off Gong’s rollout and blog promotion to Chandler, and finish Intercom production setup. Ciro will merge and publish the Intercom app, Jonathas is finishing Trello incremental scrape and will open a Snowflake support ticket on rate limits, and Konrad will deploy the HubSpot fix.

It's good to be back.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Ask it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And this is at the snowflake layer that we're seeing those rate limits.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Feel pretty rusted.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: That's nice.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: We ended up seeing seven national parks, which was kind of crazy.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Wow.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Let's pray.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So we went through. We saw three in Colorado and then four in Utah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Where did you go in Utah. My brother lives in Utah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Does he really? So we went to Arches national park and then Canyon Lands, Bryce Canyon and Capitol Reef.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: It was sweet. Bryce Canyon caught me off guard. We've been to Arches before. Which Arches is super sick? It's so beautiful.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: But Bryce Canyon was amazing too, because it's like an alpine zone, which is crazy. So it's like you have this desert formation looking stuff with a bunch of pine trees and, like, snow. So it was kind of wild.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: But we had fun.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Very cool.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then just crazy family Thanksgiving stuff.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: But how was your guys this week? Last week?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Really good, I think.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Yeah. We had two connectors finishing, so one of us.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Wait, What? What's the second connector?\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Asana and snowflake.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, okay, okay. I was like, jauthis, knock it out. Two connectors. Cool, cool, cool. All right, all right, all right, all right, let's go, let's go.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Conrad. Did you get contacts or something? I feel like. Didn't you have glasses?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah, I am wearing contacts today. I literally only wear them.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: For sports stuff. And I actually did a VO2 max test this morning, which was pretty fun. Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, sick. Are you training for something?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: So this is the thing. I normally would not do something like that, but my wife gave it to me as a birthday gift specifically because I said, oh, it'd be kind of fun, but I just wouldn't buy that. She was like, nice. So, honestly, really thoughtful birthday gift.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: But it was good.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Wait. When was your birthday?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, okay.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: It was a while ago, but. July. Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: All right.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: It was, like, scheduled the test, ended up getting injured a few weeks before it. So I was like, if you get a reschedule it now, we're here.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Well, I'll remember that for next July.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Nice. It's actually my birthday is Canada Day, July 1, which is fun.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, okay.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Wow.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Nice.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Nice. The whole nation is celebrating your birthday.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: See the fireworks, and I think, thank you. This is my personal fireworks show, is a good use of taxpayer dollars. I'm very happy about this.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I love it.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: That's true.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: That's hilarious. That's awesome.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Sierra, did you have a good week last week?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Nice.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah, pretty fun. Learn it a lot of things from our code base, and I think.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: From all the tests that I ran. It's all running fine. So, like, again, like, all the semantic queries, the stuff like, it seems to be how good, how indexed on.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Coke.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Ah, okay.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: The turbo buffer embeddings. So I think maybe there is something that I don't know that I don't know yet. So I'm still like, running tests majorly. Like, I found a small bug this morning. Gonna get it fixed, but I think we are good to merge. At least merge into master. And then enable the flag once I'm done with all the tests. And probably the next step is just creating the production app on Intercoms website site or developer site, whatever they call it. But for that I need some stuff that I don't know where to get. For example, icon we need like to submit an icon, a description for the app and a bunch of metadata.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: But that was pretty much it, man. It was, like, a nice week, to be honest. Very nice. A lot of progress from my side.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Awesome.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Alrighty.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Let's see. I will share out the notion. Doc, here.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: We can get to crank it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: This week. I'm on call, actually, for Grapevine Core, so I may have little things that pop up that disrupt my goals this week.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: But that is something to be aware of.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then there were a few little laundry lists, items that I didn't get knocked out before I left on vacation.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So I'm going to resume those today and get those knocked out, including connector health checks.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: There's, like, the final pieces for that, which I'm excited about.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I feel like that one's dragged on too long.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So going to get it knocked out today.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Let's see.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I'll also check up on all of our Marketplace review.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Stuff like for HubSpot, Trello and Salesforce, and just see how that's kind of generally going. Pretty sick that Gong looked like Gong got it published.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So we'll make sure we get the blog posts and stuff out for that this week.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I read through all the stand up stuff. Thanks, guys for hosting all that. That's super useful. Decided to get Asana out there. Looks like Snowflake is kind of chugging along.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Or it's, like, live, I mean, which is exciting.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And probably have, like, another connector on deck.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And we can talk about that after Stand up next kind of connector priorities.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Kind of getting bombarded by customers for a few of these.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So, yeah, we can chat about that after seeing it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: All right. I'm going to pass it off to Sarah.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Last Friday I finish up with a help center integration.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: And article stuff. So that was like, pretty much, I think, the last feature request from what I got from our clients. Then I ran the first, like, end to end testing. Just, like, run a semantic query and see if everything makes sense, if the model can actually. The agent can answer the questions that we have. So far, so good. I ended up creating a few scripts to push data to the developer hub as well, because they have such as mouse sample that we could just use. So I just like, you know, just.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: GPT 5.1 create that script and ingest a bunch of text over there so we can query later. And I did it for a conversation for companies and pretty much all the endpoints that we are granting.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: And then like for today, gonna merge things to master create the application, the production app on Developer Hub.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: And there is, like, a few bugs that I found as well on the article center on the help center article help center that I'm fixing right now.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: But I think that's pretty much from my side.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Okay, next is you, jonathan.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Wrong side.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: You were pointed the other way.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yo. Okay.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I'm on the top left.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: So on my side last week. Let's try. I open a PR for I was kind of doing the connectors with cube.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Like, taking a look. I have, like, migrating to endpoints.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But they realized that we don't have yet the basis.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: For anything that I think was on your ticket. Kind of dependent.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yes.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And then. Okay, let's see if I can add. At least put something here and we can discuss maybe next week.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And then I create, like, a new.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Kind of project.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Inside connectors.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: A new API.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Added. Hooked up this with tilt and mice and everything. Mice?\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And it kind of works.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Is it me, smize miz. Sorry.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Yeah. I'm not like the French guy here, Conrad for sure.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And I tested API like making requests like the authentication flow for the work os, jwt and everything works.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But I also was talking with Conrad quickly and he had some ideas on the automation from the contracts between the front end and the back end, are they going to be defined? And all this stuff that I didn't implement there was mainly like a basic web server with the same structure of the JS admin backend.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: So I think in this week we can probably discuss what direction we're going to take there.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But, yeah, the pr is there.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Also.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I run your suggestion channel doing refactory for the validation where the course shouldn't be aware what kind of validation is done. The logic should be within each of the let's say webhook its own responsibility. So I did some refactor there as well.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: So you can also take a look. It kind of became larger than I thought. The refactor.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But I think works.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Basically moving code around and making it more scalable, let's say.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And I created some base validations.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: That each connectors can implement and customize if they want.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But the base validation, which is the hmac, is kind of the default behavior. And if you have another one, you can just use.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But we can discuss if that's what we intended.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Those comments in the PR itself.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Also maybe need to align somehow with the connectors video because.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Could be.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Like, indication how the architecture is going to. What the architecture is going to become in the future as well.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And I create a ticket also for Trello Incremental scrape.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And I'm working on that. I think the Trello webhook It's kind of weird in the sense that we discuss, I think last last week on which entity you attach. And there is not better entity. And there are issues that Conrad also brought up with the visibility when you attach the user itself. So. I migrate into the incremental scrape.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: So since we also want this direction anyway.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I think it's much more, much better approach than actually relying on these crazy webhooks that each of them, they have their own kind of behavior and it complicates stuff. And we want to simplify, but still keep the feature as covering the user requirements as possible.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: So it should be something quick. In a sense, I should finish by the end of the day. And if we decide which connector or what we're going to do next, I can also shift gears if it's not done, but I hope it's going to be done by the end of the day.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Conrad.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Will we have any webhook support left for Trello, or are we just migrating fully to the Cron jobs?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: We don't have to.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I think we can.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Yeah, I think we can at least keep the ones that. Although it's also been covered by the GRP GPR compliance, but when the user is deleted, all the permissions revoked, these webhooks we can probably keep just for like a proactive kind of approach.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: No.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But I also updated last week as well. Like the Trello or documentation, you can call out if the user kind of is removed from the organization, et cetera. So maybe create like a service kind of level account instead of using specific user. So I kind of added these informations last week also to the Trello documentation.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Just to make them aware of this risk as well.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Yeah. On the snowflake, like you mentioned, is already done. And there is nothing else. It took a long time passing.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I created.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Like the evolve sheet, like the JSON, where you have the question and the answer.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But there are some running these, there are some rate limiting when you do, like locally.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: So I had only six questions, but it's still like one or two questions. I still get the rate limit by Snowflake. Sometimes not reliable running the A valve, but when you are lucky they valve returns five out five.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Answer.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, nice.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But yeah, when you are not lucky, it's because one of the questions got rate limited.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: By the valuation because it starts a lot of queries at the same time. Right. The value script.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: In real time. This is not going to happen anyway because you just ask one by one by the MCP server. But since this eval two kind of each actually request, each question might become actually more than one request. Right? Because they might change their agent, might change the question in a different way. Rephrase it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Gotcha.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And send three times, four times, sometimes per question. So when you have six, multiply this by five. So it's no flake. Sometimes complaints. But that's just our valuation script itself.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Right.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And you need also to be mindful. The question needs to be at a point in time kind of question because you should know, okay, how many blah, blah, blah needs to be in October 2024, blah, blah, blah, something that is frozen in time.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: As well to be more stable.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, sure, yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: That makes sense.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Yeah, the cortex.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: The cortex, okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Is that something that's configured? Is that like a hard limit or a soft limit?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Do you know?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I mean, this is poor integration, right? We don't have, like. It's not our app itself. We don't have an app.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Right.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: So I believe you can raise the limits by your own, like Snowflake if you want. Like if you have. If you are a very heavy user and if somehow there is a use case that you need, like maybe 50 queries per minute or whatever you need kind of to deal with your Snowflake.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Got it.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Like configuration by raising or asking support to help. Right. It's not like on our side, let's say.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay. I'd be curious what that process would be like to raise the limits, because I'm sure that maybe we'll run into that edge case at some point.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Someone asking, right? Yeah. I can proactively create like a support ticket. Like oh, in a case that we are using cortex more than we should, how we can raise the limits There tier is more like a commercial discussion. It's more like what is the kind of discussion? It's just technical. I can just ask. That so we can put in our documentation.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool. Yeah, that'd be sweet.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Awesome. Thanks, jonathan.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I guess that leaves me.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Sorry.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: So let me think.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Friday was mostly HubSpot bugs fixing and merging. So Chandler, you messaged me about that HubSpot bug that is merged into main and just needs to get deployed.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Wait, what? Oh, my goodness.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Basically, when you hit 10k search results, it lets you page through them all and then when you try to request the next page at four hundreds. But what's funny is if you, I don't know, side tangent, but if you say it's a 10k limit. If you say cursor 10,000. 1. It's like it returns a special error that's like, oh, yeah, we have a limit on our search results. Like, you can't do that. But if you request 9980 or whatever with a page size of 21, so it goes over that limit. It just four hundreds. It's. Like, yeah, we couldn't do that. So it's like, yeah. So when you're on the boundary condition, which obviously you're going to be on the boundary condition,\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Like when you go to request that last page.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Right? Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yes.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: It's just so dumb, because even when I'm handling it in the code, it's like, well, I can't just request and respond to all four hundreds because that's, like, a gross overcatch. What I'm doing is just tracking the actual number on our side and being like, okay. I know that when you hit 10k, but that's unfortunate because it's like they can change that and blah blah blah, whatever. Anyways, there's lots of comments in that section of code to just be like, this is why we're doing it this way. Trust.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Sweet.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: And then also for some reason, it seems like the refresh token stuff started failing.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Sometimes and locally.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Interesting.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: It happened when I was. Because you pass in parameters to the method and it was like, we're passing in for the parameters that aren't required. We're passing in none.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Which you think would be fine, but it was failing locally. So I take those parameters out and then all of a sudden starts working. So I did that, and that should fix. It's just weird because some of our HubSpot stuff is clearly working fine on prod, but some of it is failing to refresh.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Right.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Thankfully, it reproduced locally, so that error should also be good to go.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: It's merged in. Should be good to deploy.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Three.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: And then today I'm not sure 100% what I'm going to do, but my plan was to maybe move on to some of the V2 connectors. API stuff. But I think it's worth just chatting and syncing up on what next priorities are.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yep.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: But yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: That's kind of.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah, let's definitely do that after. Stand up here.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: For sure.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Jordan.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Cool.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I see a new challenger has joined.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Hey.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yes. Welcome to the arena.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Hi, Siro. I haven't met you yet.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Let me see.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I'm good. I'm good.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: How's it going, Jordan?\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I just wanted to\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: close the loop on Gong. So it's\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: it's been approved. It's listed. It's live.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: struggle a little on\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: if I should\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: handle the rollout, but I think maybe it's better to hand it off\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: because they have other priorities for me. So\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: so\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Totally.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: so,\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: yeah, I'm gonna hand it off to you guys to actually release it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: It just sounds good.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: It should\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yep. Do you know what's left?\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: in terms of\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: code,\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I don't think there is a lot\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: or anything.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cat.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I did see I did see, like, just\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: by by chance that there was\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: one of these arrays somewhere where it's not added.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I'm trying to remember what array it was.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: But there there's there's an array of connectors, and it's missing, like, Google emails. It's missing Gong. It's missing a couple. So it's one of these\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, okay.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: walled codes situations. Don't think\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Gotcha.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: we\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: yeah. But it's code complete.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I did not touch it after, like, connector two, so I haven't migrated anything there.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: It might already be correct because I think it's in the Gong folder. I think it's\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: been\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: migrated over.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: So, anyways,\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Three.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I had a customer lined up\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: if we wanted to do, like, a soft launch with them.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: They have 24,000 records, so it's a good test of everything.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Like, we can we can test with them. It's a medallion.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I could tag one of you or both of you\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: on the thread so you can take it over and on them. If you want,\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yep.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Otherwise, I'll leave it up to your discretion how you're gonna release this.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool. Why don't you just tag me for now, and then we'll get the right folks on it.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Alright.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Good.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Today.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Awesome. Thanks, jordan.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: You're the man. Thanks for getting this across the facial light, dude.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: It just like a email change. You see me and the person saying, like, hey. I did\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: this. And she was like,\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I don't see it. I'm like,\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I did. Oh, yeah. Now I see it. And she did the same thing with me. Like,\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: released. I'm like, I don't see it.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: I look again. Oh, yeah. I see it.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Nice.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, man. Well, I did go to their marketplace or whatever, and I searched Grapevine this morning, and I was like, it's there. Let's go. Love seeing it.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Instead she cleared the cache, I'm like, did she clear it locally, or did you clear it at some other\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: system?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: But, yeah, once she said that, I did see it too.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool. Go, go.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Alright. Then I'll leave you guys to it. I'll tag you, Chandler.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: And you guys can take it from here.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Alright.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Sounds good.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Awesome.\n  - c748ef4e-3859-461e-9110-19430d7bcecd|Jordan: Bye, guys.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Peace. Thanks, jordan.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: All right, man. Three connectors. Let's go. We're really home. And guys. And almost intercom. Okay. Should we chat next priorities.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So I think we have two kind of.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Higher priority connectors.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Let me share this really quick.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I never want to do that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So essentially.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: There's really three things that are mine. So there's the Addio, and then Fireflies is also one that's been recently requested.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: More strategically interesting because the same people who cognition who creates Devon basically they are connected to a company that once a Firefly's connector. So like, anyway, there's some strategic business value to get Fireflies on. And the same thing with adio so that we can kind of get up on cognitions.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Radar because our goal is right now to get more tightly integrated with them, which is pretty cool.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So we're actively talking with them on that. So anyway, those are two really good strategic things to get done. The other one that is interesting that I think is just like a good catch all, is custom data having just like a custom data connector. So what I'm thinking here is basically just expanding support for this. In our REST API, where customers can basically just index whatever they want. I think the biggest thing here to consider. Well, it's super interesting is just like pricing and how we handle scaling of pricing. Because right now, the way that we scale pricing is based on questions asked and not data indexed. But obviously, if you can index however much data you want here, you could really abuse our bill to some of the providers. So anyways, that's something to consider here too. But the thing that's interesting to me about this is we basically then have like a catch all to customers. So we don't have a connector supported yet. They could theoretically just index custom data themselves. So strategically, those three are really interesting.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then we also have a bit of a backlog of things to kind of knock out, including the gong rollout here.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So part of my inclination is that we kind of spend.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Maybe like a day or two, even if it's just like one person working on some of the backlog items just so that we can kind of get caught up and not get too far behind on that stuff. But I do think the AD I O and Fireflies integrations would be a huge win to get those knocked out sooner rather than later.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So maybe it'd be worth doing some research on that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Today for both of those, just to see how ridiculous it would be or what the complexity is, what the effort is basically to get those done, and then we have more data points so that we can go back and talk about that with the rest of the team.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So I don't know if anybody is attracted to either of these. Adio is basically a CRM.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I just kind of, like, tentatively put you on that, Jonathan, but really it's just kind of up in the air for anybody. So, yeah, curious if you guys have any thoughts on that. And then, Cyril, I know you're coming up soon after the intercom connector, and we can kind of look at next priorities there. Too.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Go.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I'm up for any connector. Which one do you prefer to got done first?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I am down for either. It looks like Fireflies has graphql, which is kind of nice for our purposes.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: But I don't mind doing either.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: You made your choice, man.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Let's go. Let's go.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Okay. I'm on fireflies.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay, sweet.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: All right.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Let's go.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah. So let's try and get that kind of pinned down today on how long we think it would take to launch that so that we can have an answer for that today.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then, I guess. Zero. Maybe after you're done with Intercom, you can start helping with some of the backlog items.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Of course.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool. That'll get you some exposure, then to some of these other connectors.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then also for me.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I've got some backlog items to knock out and then I'm on call this week, so I expect that to take some time.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I might be able to then put some energy into custom data. We have actually kind of like an alpha of this already implemented on custom data. We just kind of need to finish it up and then also add in rest endpoints to actually let customers use it and then answer the pricing kind of model question.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: All right, well, I think that makes sense, I guess. Are there any burning backlog items, like. Conrad, I know you got the HubSpot fix, which is great.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I just put up a promotion PR so we can get all that stuff into prod. But is there anything else that I'm not thinking of?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: That would kind of that we should divert our attention to before jumping on those new connectors.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I think maybe just like Jonathan's PR less year plan for connectors API stuff. Not that we have to start using it immediately.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I think if we get some groundwork laid by the end of this week, that means when I have free time, I can chip away at stuff. And same with everyone if they want to.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Three.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Do. I do strongly believe that will make our. Just having it all in Python just makes it better for everyone, I think.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Totally agree with you.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: But I don't think it's a huge rush to try to do it before doing these connectors or anything like that at all. I think it's fine.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yes.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Maybe.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I can set a goal along because I'm kind of on a bunch of laundry list things. Maybe what I'll do is I'll just unassign myself from this guy, this custom data thing.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then we'll knock that out when we can. Let me get rid of this do date.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: What?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: For the custom data 1. Do we think it's, like, something people will seriously use, or is it more of, like, a sales tool where it's like, look, we can do this.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I think it's kind of a combination. Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: We have had some requests for it, but I think it's also a sales tool.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: For sure.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: To be able to say, like, oh, yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: If we don't have a connector for it yet.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Just upload your own data.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: And what that looks like? Like the customer is going to upload some CSV files.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah. So the thought.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So the thought here is that basically we would let customers create their own documents, their own custom documents.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So they would go straight to the indexing step, where basically they would queue up documents to be indexed, and they could make that document whatever shape they want, as long as it's in plain text.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Got it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And so it could be.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Anything, really.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Honestly, if we do like a batch upload through the admin, that might be better than a REST API.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I don't know. Just thinking a lot.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: No, that's a good idea. Yeah, we could have a bachelor like. We could use that rest API then to have a batch upload.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: God true.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: What I was thinking also is like you. You could have the. The upload. I think it's a nice one for especially a non tech maybe.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Very focused, like end company, which is a lot. We have so many, like, maybe accountant companies or whatever.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: They even like legal companies that might benefit from just uploading docs and they just integrate them everywhere. Like the knowledge of the company itself would be much but I think like at a very low, a very low, let's say effort as well would be like as we. You need to do for Prometheus.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: You just have, like, an endpoint that outputs. You just call. Like, it's not even, like, parameters or anything, just authenticated that. You just call with.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And it just outposts, like a JSON.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Record data with whatever in premature. I think it's just the metric. But in our case, we just did documents that you need to kind of consume.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And it just time to time, just call this endpoint and check that.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And for companies that have very little tech as well, would be very easy to do that as well.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But I see a lot the benefit for sure they upload. I think it makes sense as well.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool. Yeah, those are all really good ideas.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah, that seems like it could be really useful. There's, like, an edge Casey thing here that I think would be sweet to tackle at some point.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Make sure this and basically.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I don't think we have an issue for this yet, but basically the idea is we need better file transformation.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Capability. So what I mean by that is support for pdfs. Okay? We have a lot of different places.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: That we could be getting PDFs from, like, Google Drive, GitHub, whatever, and we don't have a unified file transformation.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Type of thing.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And I think it would be really nice at some point.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: To have a core.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Basically like utility or helper that would process whatever that file type is across and give that capability to any connector. So if there's any unstructured file type, we can essentially process that, but we process it in the same way across the board.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So anyway.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah, I agree.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I can see that it being applied to uploading stuff.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: You could drag in a bunch of pdfs, then in the admin you want, and then we can just process it properly.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Sorry, Connor. What were you going to say?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Right? Right.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I said, yeah, I agree. I think there's maybe two separate things here where it's like, connectors probably don't necessarily care about putting a PDF as a document, but someone uploading a PDF might be like, I just want this PDF to be a document. But they could use a lot of the same. Underlying stuff and whatever.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yes.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Nice.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: All right, well, I think that we're all aligned, then. So fireflies and at I O and then zero once you're done.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: On intercom. Help him work on working down the backlog.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Sec.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay, last question. Did we find the cycle stuff useful at all, or should I turn it off?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Is it a distraction?\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I think for me, it was useful. Like, if I didn't have anything on my plate and I could just look at this cycle and get the next thing.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cat.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: That's essentially what happened.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But if we would like to actually hit the 100%, it's going to be very challenging, I would say.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But it depends how we scope, how many we add to the side collection.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah, to me.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I'm not super hung up on hitting a 100% target, unless we feel like we want some sort of artificial pressure to improve our performance as a team, but.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Broken.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: But I feel like we're moving pretty quick, so I'm not hung up on that. Also on that Jothis. One of the things I'm thinking about is what if we just had in our all issues all of these to dos just kind of prioritize properly.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So we could just see the whole backlog across the whole team.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: In one place.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Instead of cycles.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah, Just so we have, like, one less. I mean, if it's useful.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Totally. We can keep the cycles going.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: I just don't want to add anything that's, like, unnecessary.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: I mean, I feel that cycles.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Like a counterpoint of having just the backlog. It's just that you can align whatever you choose in this cycle.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: The objectives of that week.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: True.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: So if there is a way to describe also the cycle, okay, we want these days and that.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And it's an easy way to go and see. Okay. Actually, that's what we need for this week. Might be useful.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But anyway, the backlog for sure. Having that in the right parity, it's useful.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: But I know that we set the week's goals.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: At least on a high level. And having cycles might.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Kind of keep us focused on these goals, let's say. Could be, could work, could not work as well.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Conrad and Sarah. How do you guys feel about that?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I'm pretty fine with cycles. I found it wasn't.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Too much overhead. Like, I was pretty good at remembering to put stuff in the cycle as I did. Take it. Admin stuff.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay, okay.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I wouldn't like. I didn't. I don't think I clicked on the cycles page one time. So for the value, I'm probably not getting any value out of it, but I'm happy to do it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Sounds good.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah, same for me. I sort of forgot about cycles. First three days I remember on Thursday only. And that's pretty much. It's sort of a mix, right, Because I sort of had everything prioritized my mind and all the on the backlog. So it's sort of, I mean, honestly, totally up to you guys, I can just. It's just a matter of dragging things and just, like, a new field for each issue. I mean, totally up to you guys.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: As long as we don't have cycle planning and cycle retrospective every week, then it doesn't bother me at all.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Too much overhead.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: No. No way. Definitely not.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: It's not too much overhead at all at this point.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: We need to buy the pointing dac, Right? Everyone raises. Oh, it's an eight pointer. We lose, like, three hours doing that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, my gosh, dude.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: We add a screw, Master. Right.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah. You know what we actually need is we need to hire a fifth team member who is a dedicated Scrum Master. Yeah.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: We need a screw master cycle master now.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Man.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yikes.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: No way. Oh, my gosh, dude. Well, I have some horrific sprit play meetings that have literally lasted two days before, and I don't ever want to repeat that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Now I measure things. Then you have those metrics, right? So story points versus T shirt size. You know, there is, like, some weird metrics that people come up with. Oh, T shirt size. What the heck, man? It's just like. It's just like high effort, low or medium, just pretty much. It's crazy.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: This story is like a 30 versus a 32.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Well.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Or what is up with the story points?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Like, Fibonacci numbers thing. I kind of get the rationale, but it's like, yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah, I think it's just.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: You know, I think it was just, like, some random scale.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: You know, so you didn't have to think about small, like, specific individual numbers. But that's it. Like, everybody. Everybody has, like, specific ways they interpret that, too. So it's, like, basically meaningless. It could mean effort, relative effort, or, like, hours, you know, like, everybody's got, like, a different, like, thing that they. Do. Just kind of crazy.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay, well, maybe we'll keep it on this week to see if it adds any value this week. And if it doesn't add any value this week, then we'll turn it off. Because I'm not all about the extra bureaucracy stuff.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: All right, cool, guys.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Well, we'll see you later. Let me know if you need anything from me.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Cool. Sounds good. Thank you.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Thanks, guys. Bye.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Peace.\n\n\nChat Messages:\n\n2025-12-01T18:05:57.305+00:00 <@346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|@Chandler>: <https://www.notion.so/gathertown/Grapevine-Connector-Standup-2bcbc7eac3d180699a5be136004a5ca4?source=copy_link>\n2025-12-01T18:09:22.823+00:00 <@369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|@konrad>: thats smart, I hit dupelicate 100 times on asana to get some data volume for testing lolol\n2025-12-01T18:10:58.007+00:00 <@346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|@Chandler>: meeeeese?\n2025-12-01T18:25:09.653+00:00 <@88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|@Jonathas>: You can finally leave us Jordan :broken_heart:\n2025-12-01T18:29:29.243+00:00 <@88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|@Jonathas>: They could just provide an endpoint like prometheus does when scraping for metrics\n2025-12-01T18:35:19.068+00:00 <@369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|@konrad>: yup yup nobody wants to try to get dev resources to do stuff like this\n2025-12-01T18:37:14.779+00:00 <@369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|@konrad>: Asana attachments\n2025-12-01T18:42:28.450+00:00 <@369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|@konrad>: me seeing the graphs for the first time :eyes:\n2025-12-01T18:43:54.376+00:00 <@88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|@Jonathas>: Pants size\n2025-12-01T18:44:31.822+00:00 <@8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|@Ciro>: lol\n2025-12-01T18:44:34.958+00:00 <@88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|@Jonathas>: If > 13, split into 8 + 5",

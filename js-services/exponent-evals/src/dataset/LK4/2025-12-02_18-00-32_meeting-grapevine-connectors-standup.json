Jonathas is debugging a webhook refactor that broke staging before resuming the Addio connector work. Konrad confirmed Asana is production-ready, began Zendesk Help-Center syncing, and outlined Fireflies integration details. Ciro’s Intercom connector PR is nearly set for production, pending final tests and marketplace submission. Chandler is driving reliability—clearing alert noise, migrating off legacy installation tables, and expanding health-check coverage—while also validating Asana in prod and coordinating Intercom submission. No major blockers surfaced; next steps center on final fixes, submissions, and incremental feature rollouts.\n\nNotes:\n\nWebhook & Addio (Jonathas):\n  - Staging break traced to new webhook refactor; fix in progress\n  - Trello incremental backfill completed\n  - Addio connector implementation to resume once webhook issue resolved\n\nIntegration Pipeline (Konrad):\n  - Fireflies: APIs support date-window sync; will use customer-provided API keys\n  - Zendesk: Help-Center article sync started; incremental API support available\n  - Asana connector tested on staging and judged production-ready\n  - Closed obsolete promotion PR; minor HubSpot fix deployed\n\nIntercom Progress (Ciro):\n  - Local dev environment reset; PR ready for merge, still under test\n  - Feature flag off, so safe to merge without exposing to users\n  - Marketplace submission needs to be initiated\n\nPlatform Reliability & Ops (Chandler):\n  - Reducing alert-channel noise—goal: minimal by week’s end\n  - Migrating off legacy installations tables today\n  - Adding broader connector health-check coverage and UI indicators\n  - Will validate Asana in prod and announce\n  - Plans to kick off Intercom marketplace submission once code merged\n\nAction Items:\n  - description='Resolve webhook refactor break on staging and notify team' due_date=None assignee='Jonathas'\n  - description='Implement Zendesk Help-Center article syncing' due_date=None assignee='konrad'\n  - description='Build Fireflies integration' due_date=None assignee='konrad'\n  - description='Finalize Intercom connector, merge to main, ensure production readiness' due_date=None assignee='Ciro'\n  - description='Submit Intercom connector to Marketplace' due_date=None assignee='Ciro'\n  - description='Migrate off old installations tables' due_date=None assignee='Chandler'\n  - description='Expand connector health-check coverage and surface status in UI' due_date=None assignee='Chandler'\n  - description='Reduce alert noise in #alerts channel to near-zero' due_date=None assignee='Chandler'\n  - description='Connect Asana in production and announce success' due_date=None assignee='Chandler'\n\nTranscript:\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I just said back into the groove of things.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, yeah. Back into the groove of things.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: That's kind of one of those things that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: But yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: How is it like a lifetime thing? Like, oh, if you've ever run under three hours, or is it like within the last year or something?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I will do that.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Sounds good.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Okay, I closed that pull request. Nice.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Their developer programs a little weird because I think they're a newer company. So I filled out a form to try to get a developer account, and then they do have a partnered integration side of things. So you submit a form and then they list you as a partner integration, but it doesn't seem like that's necessary for us to just build integrations.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: They only do API key. There's no OAuth. So we'll basically get our customers to put their API key into our thing. And there's nothing that says that that's against I didn't read all the docs, but I didn't see anything that said don't share this or whatever.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I think. I mean, it's the only option anyways. So either they shut us down and tell us no, or it's fine and, yeah, whatever.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: And then today. Oh, and there was a Zendesk bug that I fixed yesterday, so that got a customer up and running. Today I'm doing the for Zendesk, they have, like, the ticketing side, which we did, and they also have the help center side with, like, help center articles. And so we're gonna start syncing.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah, I do have. So confluence gives us stuff in HTML, actually. And then I ran it through a HTML to markdown converter.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Nice.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Nice.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Crazy. Well, I will say that local Stack UI I think is Vibe coded, so it's not like an official ui, so there could be some bug.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Okay. I didn't know that. That's okay. That's a good thing. But anyways, that was actually a good opportunity for me to wipe up and restart everything again with another mindset, now that I've been here for two weeks. So it was pretty cool, honestly.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yep.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Bye.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, you cut out for a sec. What would you say?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Vacation is a distant memory now.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yes. Distant memory.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Did. We've got a big. We're planning on going to Europe in the spring for. My wife's brother actually lives in Denmark and he's getting married.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: So we're planning our first international family trip, which should be fun.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, what?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Let's go. That's going to be exciting.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah, yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: It's in late may, I think.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Nice.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: That'll be fun.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Should be nice. Yeah. And I've actually never been to Europe, so it'll be my first time as well.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Dude.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Nice.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Which will be hype.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Actually, I haven't either, which is crazy.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Ever in either does when they're younger, because they're like, I don't know.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Filled with motivation and wonder, or you just kind of get into the grind of life and it's like, I don't know, I enjoy. We just do vacations up to Parksville, which is, like, I don't know, two hours north of here. And that's super fun. I enjoy vacationing around or. Even going off to Washington State. We do all sorts of vacations down there and stuff and.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, yeah, totally, totally.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I don't know, like, Canada and America have some pretty good. Good stuff going on, especially if you're into nature, you know?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: 100%.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: We've almost been to every state in the US Now.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Dude, that's sweet.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: It's pretty.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah. North America is a beautiful continent.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: For sure.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: There's a lot to see.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I feel like I've been to a handful of states, like I've been to all the ones on the west coast and then.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I've been.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Not any.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I don't know, a couple on the east coast as well, because I went to a wedding. But I've never been to New York or anything in the Midwest or anything around the Great Lakes or anything like that.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Nice.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Chicago is amazing. I mean, I grew up in Illinois, so I'm kind of biased to it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I actually have. I think I'm going to do a trip to Chicago at some point in the future, fairly, because I want to run the Chicago Marathon one day. That's, like, on my bucket list.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, yeah.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Oh, boy. So you're a pro. You know that you have to qualify and you have to run a marathon, like under three hours and something, right?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Oh, my God, that's awesome.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah, if you wanted time.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: If you want a time qualify. So Chicago has a lottery. So you can just enter the lottery and get picked or. But if you want a time qualify, I think it's like three hours or something.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Whoa. Okay.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: My best Marathon time is 2:53, so I'm already under there.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: That's insane. You are insanely fast.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So you qualify. Wait. What's the latest?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Wow.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: For most of them, it's within the last two years and then it goes invalid. I know Boston is like the big one that everyone tries to get into because Boston is no lottery, all qualifiers, so it's considered like, prestigious and all that stuff. But their qualifying time, I think I would have had to run 2:49 to qualify, which I didn't. And so it is what it is. But I kind of want. I don't have, like, a huge desire to do Boston. I know it sounds silly, but it's like, I really like the idea of Chicago because it's like the world record, both men's and women's was set at Chicago. And it's just more of, like, I don't know, you run through the city, like the lakes and stuff, and, I don't know, it just seems like a more chill race, whereas Boston is, like, crazy.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I don't know. I would do both for sure.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: But yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Me too, man, but My time is 2 hours 20 on half marathon.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: There's just mild detail. It's happened.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Honestly, running a three hour marathon is like, I've been running for like, I don't know, I haven't been running that long, but for almost three years. But I've been taking it very seriously for the last, I don't know, two years or so and.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: It's very hard.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: It's pretty hard.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I remember doing my.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: It's pretty hard, man. Like, completely. A full marathon is already hard because when I did my first half marathon, I was like, holy shit. Now I sort of understand what it's a full marathon. It's, like, two times what I've done. And it's tough, man. It is very tough. Just the fact that you run, like, for three hours on, like, I don't know, 15 kilometers per hour speed, something like that. It's insanely fast. You have to be very well prepared. How old are you, by the way?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: 32.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: 32. Nice. So young.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah. Still in prime years for running for sure.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah, of course.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I think people start to drop off around, like, 40 to 45 is when you really start dropping off for distance running anyways. But up until 40, it's like there's no excuses for sprinting. People sometimes drop off earlier because it's more explosive and stuff.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Although Justin gatlin of the US set his PB when he was, like, in his late 30s.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Sorry.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: You are breaking up, Chandler.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay? Hopefully. Am I back?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yes.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: The three second delay did not boost my confidence when you guys said yes. Okay. All right, Jonathan, do you want to start us off today?\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Let me find my button here to unmute myself. I was trying to see the relic.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Cool my side yesterday, mainly finishing the Trello's incremental backfield.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Also was studying the etio documentation radically create like a project and tickets breakdown for that.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Today I was also fixing some trailer stuff still merged that I also took a look at the webhook. It was working for the ones that I tested, but it seems that the one that I didn't test is breaking staging. So I'm going to try to verify since I didn't have this locally.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: So I'm checking now. The webhook new refactor. What broke there?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: And after that, I will resume the Addio connector implementation.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Do you want to go NextComrize or do you have any question channel Actually.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah, I was just gonna say if you could let us know when you feel confident about that. Actually, Connor and I guess you'll just want to close that promotion pr because we're going to need to probably get something in.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Right, because we're going to need new stuff.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah, good call.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Sounds good. Do you have many changes in this PR promotional?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: There was only, like, a handful of pr, so that was the big one.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: The only thing I was trying to deploy. Just a small HubSpot fix.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Oh, I see.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah, but it's not a huge rush, I don't think.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Sounds good. I should have something.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Probably next one or two hours, hopefully.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah, no worries.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: It's better to get it right than to rush it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: 100%.\n  - 88061651-6a26-450f-b15b-3c10cb964201|Jonathas: Correct.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: So yesterday I was looking into Fireflies and the rundown is they have decent APIs that will work for how we've been doing our syncs. You can get transcripts in date windows, so that's great. And then.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Help center articles as well.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Which should be easier than tickets, because there's just, like, not as many of them. Like tickets. There can be so many tickets. Whereas Help center articles are like content that somebody has gone and made and published. So it's like, I imagine most organizations will have in the range of 100 to 1000 of these. Versus tickets. There's like hundreds of thousands of these things floating around. So that's nice. And the help center APIs are. There's some somewhat similar ones, but there's enough that lets us do like date windows and grab stuff by date windows, which is all we need. And they have a. You can get stuff updated since. So it's like, for incremental syncing, we can get. Okay. Help center articles updated since the last incremental sync. So that's all good on that front.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: And that should be a pretty quick to add, and then the prospective customer should be happy about that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool is the thought that will basically just convert it to markdown. Do they give it to us in markdown or something?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: I think they give it to us possibly an HTML or it might be marked down with embedded HTML. I will confirm that. But that was kind of my thought is I was looking at it and I was roughly like, okay, we can just take the content and put it in a document with like a little meta header or whatever.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah, so I'll just copy that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So probably could take the same route there.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah, that makes sense.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Okay, that's kind of it for me. Siro, do you want to go next?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: So yesterday I sort of messed it up with my Lookout dev environment, so I sort of restarted everything again. So I killed all the containers, removed images, and that's mainly because I couldn't purge a queue on my local environment. It was, like, stuck. And even though I was actually logging in on the local stack ui, that you can actually go over there and purge things. It was coming back. It was like. I thought it was like.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Whoa.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Some ground process running that it was not killed properly. Maybe when I ran like tilt down or something like this and it was like boop popping and populizing, man. It's a ghost or something like this. Yeah, it was weird.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: So, man.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: It might be dark here. Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah. There might be some bug in there.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Now. One thing that I'm not super worried. Ghost vibes.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: But I think there is some leftover of the previous tenant on Turbo buffer, because when I run things obviously like there is like a cost with that, and I'm not sure if I should go ahead and Delete things from TurboPuffer or not, or just sit there forever, man. It's probably like a few cents, or it's only like this.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: But you don't have to probably bother with that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Don't worry about it.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah. Cool.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Don't worry about it. We have a script to clean up old Jordan is working on basically something to clean up old tenants.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Okay, cool.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yep.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And also you should be invited to the Gather local Turbo Buffer organization. And that has all your. The local tenants. But anyways. Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yep.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Okay, cool. I see my namespace there. And there is like a gigabyte of data. And that's just because by generator freaking pageant error. And it runs for 15 minutes and grabs the entire world and just indexes, but anyways. Yeah, apart from that.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Chandler. Like the PR is good enough to be merged right now. It's not perfect. Again. I'm still running some testing.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Mainly with the Help Center. The index is still not 100%.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: What else?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: I think.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Is it behind a feature flag, Cyril?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: The future Flag is actually disabled, like the coming soon hearsay.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah. So if we merged it and sent it to Prod, is it feature flagged so that somebody couldn't enable Connect Intercom and Prod right now?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: No, it's actually disabled. Like, there is a coming soon flag or something like that, right?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: It's disabled.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yep.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay, cool.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah. So I think it's good, like, if we merge, like, it's not going to show up for our clients.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Mprod okay, great.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Sweet.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: And I think that's it, man. Like, again, like, just testing things just to be sure that we are not gonna get bought.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: But in nasty surprises once we merge some master and enable the feature flag.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Go.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah, that's it.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Awesome, man. Well, I'll take a look at cursory look at everything and let you know if I've got any feedback.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Sounds good.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Great work.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Thanks.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay, so to wrap this up.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Now you.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: It's okay.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Oh, sweet. Thank you. I think I've got a weird delay. I'm sorry.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay, so yesterday, handling a few piddly on call issues.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: But getting the noise down on our alerts channel, which is great. Thanks for what you did Conrad yesterday on HubSpot. It's good.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And, yeah, my goal is to get us down to as low noise as possible by the end of the week because there's still a few noisy things in here.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: That.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Are very irrelevant. So anyways.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So there's that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then today I'm going to migrate us off of the old installations tables.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So getting us off of those and then adding health checks to the add menu I so that we can see people can actually see if their connector is still healthy.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And if it's not be able to reconnect or whatever.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So there's that. And then not all. Like, there are some health check edge cases. So I'm just going to be adding more health check coverage. And essentially this is something that we could just continuously improve over time. Like, for all of our existing connectors, like, there's just edge cases and stuff that we might find.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: To basically add to our health checks support and like, if there's some configuration error or some read off air, you know, that we might catch, you know, adding support for that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So anyways, continuing to add more support there.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So we've got great coverage.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So that's it for me.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yeah. Excited about getting fireflies and at IO out there.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Next week. And then I was going to ask Conrad, is asana, like, totally, totally good?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Yeah, it should be totally good.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Sweet.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Just thinking. Yeah.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Because I plugged our thing in on staging.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: And then confirmed that it was returning.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Asana stuff.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Awesome.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Which is good, I think. Obviously, no web hooks.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Yep.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: But, yeah, it should be good for customers to connect.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Amazing.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Send a celebratory. I'll do a connection and fraud really quick and then send a celebratory message.\n  - 369bb7d6-d18c-437d-9aec-0cdce743eae4|konrad: Sounds good.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then zero.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: So, let's see. Do you feel pretty good about having intercom?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Fully ready for production tomorrow. By tomorrow?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: It should be good, man. It should be good.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Sweet.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Yeah.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: And then.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool. Well done.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Are we waiting on Intercom for approval? Marketplace approval. I can't remember if we can.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: No, we have to submit that.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: We have to submit it, okay?\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: That's a great point.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool. Well, maybe we can get that submission started today.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Okay?\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: We'll get everything merged and then we can start that submission process today, just so we can get the ball rolling.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Sounds.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool. And then, yeah, once you're satisfied that everything is working as it should, then we can just turn to the backlog.\n  - 8150123e-8f2f-4d63-94be-14de6d7a4a47|Ciro: Makes sense.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Cool.\n  - 346c2afe-bd00-42f2-926b-8ca822cb86bf|Chandler: Alrighty, guys.

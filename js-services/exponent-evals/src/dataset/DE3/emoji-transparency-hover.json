This is due to our text color tokens using transparency; theme.text.primary is black w/90% alpha, secondary is 80% alpha, etc.\n\nI recently updated <Text> to accept color=\"emoji\", which assigns a solid colour so emoji look correct. (open to suggestions for a better API, this is admittedly a little weird)\n\nIf these emoji aren't inside of a <Text> component, theme.dangerouslyStatic.black should accomplish the same."
